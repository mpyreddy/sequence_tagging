The B-KP
Lobund I-KP
Institute I-KP
grew O
out O
of O
pioneering O
research O
in O
germ O
free O
life O
which O
began O
in O
1928 B-KP
. O

This O
area O
of O
research O
originated O
in O
a O
question O
posed O
by O
Pasteur O
as O
to O
whether O
animal O
life O
was O
possible O
without O
bacteria O
. O

Though O
others O
had O
taken O
up O
this O
idea O
, O
their O
research O
was O
short O
lived O
and O
inconclusive O
. O

Lobund O
was O
the O
first O
research O
organization O
to O
answer O
definitively O
, O
that O
such O
life O
is O
possible O
and O
that O
it O
can O
be O
prolonged O
through O
generations O
. O

But O
the O
objective O
was O
not O
merely O
to O
answer O
Pasteur O
's O
question O
but O
also O
to O
produce O
the O
germ O
free O
animal O
as O
a O
new O
tool O
for O
biological O
and O
medical O
research O
. O

This O
objective O
was O
reached O
and O
for O
years O
Lobund O
was O
a O
unique O
center O
for O
the O
study O
and O
production O
of O
germ O
free O
animals O
and O
for O
their O
use O
in O
biological O
and O
medical O
investigations O
. O

Today O
the O
work O
has O
spread O
to O
other O
universities O
. O

In O
the O
beginning O
it O
was O
under O
the O
Department O
of O
Biology O
and O
a O
program O
leading O
to O
the O
master O
's O
degree O
accompanied O
the O
research O
program O
. O

In O
the B-KP
1940s I-KP
Lobund O
achieved O
independent O
status O
as O
a O
purely O
research O
organization O
and O
in O
1950 B-KP
was O
raised O
to O
the O
status O
of O
an O
Institute O
. O

In O
1958 B-KP
it O
was O
brought O
back O
into O
the O
Department O
of O
Biology O
as O
integral O
part O
of O
that O
department O
, O
but O
with O
its O
own O
program O
leading O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
PhD O
in O
Gnotobiotics O

quickly O
emerged O

Yet O
this O

an O

The O
name O

comes O
from O
the O
Spanish O
word O
Monta O
a O
, O
meaning O
`` O
mountain O
'' O
, O
or O
more O
broadly O
, O
`` O

Monta B-KP
a I-KP

was O
the O
name O
given O
by O
early O
Spanish O
explorers O
to O
the O
entire O
mountainous O
region O
of O
the O
west O
. O

The O
name O
Montana O
was O
added O
to O
a O
bill O
by O
the O
United O

House O
Committee O
on O
Territories O
, O
which O
was O
chaired O
at O
the O
time O
by O
Rep. O
James O
Ashley O
of O
Ohio O
, O
for O
the O
territory O
that O
would O
become O
Idaho O
Territory O

The O
name O
was O
successfully O
changed O
by O
Representatives O
Henry O
Wilson O
( O
Massachusetts O
) O
and O
Benjamin O
F. O
Harding O
( O

complained O

`` O
no O

When O
Ashley O
presented O

territory O
to O
be O
carved O
out O
of O
Idaho O

he O
again O
chose O
Montana O
Territory O
. O

This O
time O
Rep. O
Samuel O
Cox O
, O
also O
of O
Ohio O
, O
objected O
to O
the O
name O
. O

Cox O
complained O
that O
the O
name O
was O
a O
misnomer O
given O
that O
most O
of O
the O
territory O
was O
not O
mountainous O
and O
that O
a O
Native O
American O
name O
would O
be O
more O
appropriate O
than O
a O
Spanish O
one O
. O

Other O
names O
such O
as O
Shoshone O
were O
suggested O
, O
but O
it O
was O
eventually O
decided O
that O
the O
Committee O
on O

could O
name O
it O
whatever O
they O
wanted O
, O
so O
the O
original O
name O
of O
Montana O
was O
adopted O

The O
Homestead O
Act O
of O
1862 B-KP
provided O
free O
land O
to O
settlers O
who O
could O
claim O
and O
`` O

up O
'' O
160 B-KP
acres I-KP
( O
0.65 O

) O
of O
federal O
land O
in O
the O
midwest O

western O
United O
States O
. O

Montana O
did O
not O
see O
a O
large O
influx O
of O
immigrants O
from O
this O
act O
because O
160 O
acres O
was O
usually O
insufficient O
to O
support O
a O
family O
in O
the O
arid O
territory O
. O

The O
first O
homestead O
claim O
under O
the O
act O
in O
Montana O
was O
made O
by O
David O
Carpenter O
near O
Helena O
in O
1868 B-KP

The O
first O

By O

, O
there O
were O

few O
on O
the O

The O
Desert O
Land O
Act O
of O
1877 B-KP
was O
passed O
to O
allow O
settlement O
of O
arid O
lands O
in O
the O
west O
and O
allotted O
640 B-KP
acres I-KP
( O
2.6 O

) O
to O
settlers O
for O
a O
fee O
of O
$ B-KP
.25 I-KP
per O
acre O
and O
a O
promise O
to O
irrigate O
the O
land O
. O

After O
three O
years O
, O
a O
fee O
of O
one O
dollar O
per O
acre O
would O
be O
paid O
and O
the O
land O
would O
be O
owned O
by O
the O
settler O
. O

This O
act O
brought O
mostly O
cattle O
and O
sheep O
ranchers O
into O
Montana O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
grazed O
their O
herds O
on O
the O
Montana O
prairie O
for O
three O
years O
, O
did O
little O
to O
irrigate O
the O
land O
and O
then O
abandoned O
it O
without O
paying O
the O
final O
fees O
. O

Some O
farmers O
came O
with O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
Great O
Northern O
and O
Northern O
Pacific O
Railroads O
throughout O
the O
1880s O
and O
1890s O

In O
the O
early O
1900s O
, O
James B-KP
J. I-KP
Hill I-KP
of O
the O
Great O
Northern O
began O
promoting O
settlement O
in O
the O
Montana O
prairie O
to O
fill O
his O
trains O
with O
settlers O
and O
goods O
. O

Other O
railroads O
followed O
suit O
. O

In O
1902 B-KP
, O
the O
Reclamation O
Act O
was O
passed O
, O
allowing O
irrigation O
projects O
to O
be O
built O
in O
Montana O
's O
eastern O
river O

. O

In O
1909 B-KP
, O
Congress O
passed O
the O
Enlarged O
Homestead O
Act O
that O
expanded O
the O
amount O
of O
free O
land O
from O
160 O
to O
320 B-KP
acres I-KP
( O
0.6 O
to O
1.3 O
km2 O
) O
per O
family O
and O
in O
1912 O
reduced O
the O
time O
to O
`` O
prove O
up O
'' O
on O
a O
claim O
to O
three O
years O
. O

In O
1916 O
, O
the O
Stock O
Raising O
Homestead O
Act O
allowed O
homesteads O
of O
640 O
acres O
in O
areas O
unsuitable O
for O
irrigation O
. O

This O
combination O
of O
advertising O
and O
changes O
in O
the O
Homestead O
Act O
drew O
tens O
of O
thousands O
of O
homesteaders O
, O
lured O
by O
free O
land O
, O
with O
World O
War O
I O
bringing O
particularly O
high O
wheat O
prices O

In O
addition O
, O
Montana O
was O
going O
through O
a O
temporary O
period O
of O
higher O

Homesteaders O
arriving O
in O
this O
period O
were O
known O
as O
`` O
Honyockers O
'' O
, O
or O
`` O
scissorbills O
. O
'' O

Though O
the O
word O
`` O
honyocker O
'' O
, O
possibly O
derived O
from O
the O
ethnic O
slur O
`` O
hunyak O
, O
'' O
was O
applied O
in O
a O
derisive O
manner O
at O
homesteaders O
as O
being O
`` O
greenhorns O
'' O
, O
`` O
new O
at O
his O
business O
'' O
or O
`` O
unprepared O
'' O
, O
the O
reality O
was O
that O
a O
majority O
of O
these O
new O
settlers O
had O
previous O
farming O
experience O
, O
though O
there O
were O
also O
many O
who O
did O
not O
. O

In O
June O
1917 O
, O
the O
U.S. O
Congress O
passed O
the O
Espionage O
Act O
of O
1917 B-KP
which O
was O
later O
extended O
by O
the O
Sedition O
Act O
of O
1918 B-KP
, O
enacted O
in O
May O
1918 O
. O

In O
February O
1918 O
, O
the O
Montana O
legislature O
had O
passed O
the O
Montana O
Sedition O
Act O
, O
which O
was O
a O
model O
for O
the O
federal O
version O
. O

In O
combination O
, O
these O
laws O
criminalized B-KP
criticism I-KP

or I-KP
symbols I-KP

The O
Montana O
Act O
led O
to O
the O
arrest O
of O
over O
200 B-KP
individuals O
and O
the O
conviction O
of O
78 B-KP
, O
mostly O
of O
German O
or O
Austrian O
descent O
. O

Over O
40 O
spent O
time O
in O

. O

In O
May O
2006 O
, O
then O
Governor O
Brian O
Schweitzer O
posthumously O
issued O
full O
pardons O
for O
all O
those O
convicted O
of O
violating O
the O
Montana O

Act O

When O
the O
U.S. O
entered O
World O
War O
II O
on O
December O
8 O
, O
1941 O
, O
many O
Montanans O
already O
had O
enlisted O
in O
the O
military O
to O
escape O
the O
poor O
national O
economy O
of O
the O

Another O
40,000 B-KP

in O
the O

the O

, O
and O
over B-KP
57,000 I-KP

the O

These O
numbers O
constituted O
about O
10 O
percent O

the O

Nazi B-KP
Germany I-KP
and O
its O
allies O
prior O

during O
World O

, O
Lemkin B-KP
successfully O
campaigned O
for O
the O
universal O
acceptance O
of O
international O
laws O
defining O
and O
forbidding O
genocides O
. O

In O
1946 O
, O
the O
first O
session O
of O
the O
United B-KP
Nations I-KP
General I-KP
Assembly I-KP
adopted O
a O
resolution O
that O
`` O
affirmed O
'' O
that O
genocide O
was O
a O
crime O
under O
international O
law O
, O
but O
did O
not O
provide B-KP
a I-KP
legal I-KP
definition I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
crime I-KP
. O

In O
1948 O
, O
the O
UN O
General O
Assembly O
adopted O
the B-KP
Convention I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
Prevention I-KP
and I-KP
Punishment I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Crime I-KP
of I-KP
Genocide I-KP
( O
CPPCG O
) O
which O
defined O
the O
crime O
of O
genocide O
for O
the O
first O
time O
. O

The O
first O
draft O
of O
the O
Convention O
included O
political B-KP
killings I-KP
, O
but O
these O
provisions O
were O
removed O
in O
a O
political O
and O
diplomatic O
compromise O
following O
objections O
from O
some O
countries O
, O
including O
the O
USSR B-KP
, O
a O
permanent O
security O
council O
member O
. O

The O
USSR O
argued O
that O
the O
Convention O
's O
definition O
should O
follow O
the O
etymology O
of O
the O
term O
, O
and O
may O
have O
feared O
greater O
international O
scrutiny O
of O
its B-KP
own I-KP
Great I-KP
Purge I-KP

Other O
nations O
feared O
that O

the O
definition O
would O
invite O
international B-KP
intervention I-KP
in I-KP
domestic I-KP
politics I-KP
. O

However O
leading O
genocide O
scholar O
William B-KP
Schabas I-KP
states O
: O
Rigorous O
examination O
of O
the O
travaux O
fails O
to O
confirm O
a O
popular O
impression O
in O
the O
literature O
that O
the O
opposition O
to O
inclusion O
of O
political O
genocide O
was O
some O
Soviet O
machination O
. O

The O
Soviet O
views O
were O
also O
shared O
by O
a O
number O
of O
other O
States O
for O
whom O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
establish O
any O
geographic O

The O
exclusion O
of O
political O
groups O
was O
in O
fact O
originally O
promoted O
by O
a O
non O
governmental O
organization O
, O
the O
World O
Jewish O
Congress O
, O
and O
it O
corresponded O
to O
Raphael O
Lemkin O
s O
vision O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
crime O
of O
genocide O
. O

In O
2007 O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Human O
Rights O
( O
ECHR O
) O
, O
noted O
in O
its O
judgement O
on O
Jorgic B-KP
v. I-KP
Germany I-KP
case O
that O
in O
1992 O
the O
majority B-KP
of I-KP
legal I-KP
scholars I-KP
took O
the O
narrow O
view O
that O
`` O
intent O
to O
destroy O
'' O
in O
the O
CPPCG O
meant O
the O
intended O
physical O
biological O
destruction O
of O
the O
protected O
group O
and O
that O
this O
was O
still O
the O
majority O
opinion O
. O

But O
the O
ECHR O
also O
noted O
that O
a O
minority O
took O
a O
broader O
view O
and O
did O
not O
consider O
biological B-KP
physical I-KP
destruction O
was O
necessary O
as O
the O
intent O
to O
destroy O
a O
national B-KP
, I-KP
racial I-KP
, I-KP
religious I-KP
or I-KP
ethnic I-KP
group O
was O
enough O
to O
qualify O
as O
genocide O
. O

The O
word O
genocide O
was O
later O
included O
as B-KP
a I-KP
descriptive I-KP
term I-KP
to O
the O
process O
of O
indictment O
, O
but O
not O
yet O
as O
a O
formal O
legal O
term O
According O
to O
Lemming B-KP
, O
genocide O
was O
defined O
as O
`` O
a O

Australian B-KP

describe O

the O
legal B-KP

By O
formally O
recognizing O
the O
act O

as O
a B-KP
crime I-KP

involves O
the O
undergoing O
prosecution O

with O
not O
only O
seeing O

outrageous O
past O

viewed O
as O
the B-KP
deliberate I-KP
killing I-KP

. O

Yet O
is O
commonly O
seen O
to O
escape O
the O
process O
of O
trial O
and O
prosecution O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
genocide B-KP
is I-KP
more I-KP

As O
such O
the O

Jonassohn B-KP

postulate O
that O
the O
major O
reason O
why O
no O

because O
academics O

adjusted O

it O

them O

For O
example O
, O
Frank B-KP

Kurt O

the O

1979 O

argues O
that O
the O
international O
definition O
of O

too O
restricted O
, O
and O
that O
it O
should O
include O
political B-KP
groups I-KP

any O
group O

defined O
by O

quotes O

: O
`` O

that O
the O

agreement O

Barbara O
Harff O
and O
Ted O

defined O
genocide O

`` O

Daniel O

B. O

state O
that O
`` O

'' O

According O
to O
R. O
J. O
Rummel O
, O
genocide O
has O
3 O
different O
meanings O
. O

The O
ordinary O
meaning O
is O
murder B-KP
by I-KP
government I-KP
of O
people O
due O
to O
their O
national O
, O
ethnic O
, O
racial O
, O
or O
religious B-KP
group I-KP
membership O
. O

The O
legal O
meaning O
of O
genocide O
refers O
to O
the O
international O
treaty O
, O
the O
Convention B-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
Prevention I-KP
and I-KP
Punishment I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Crime I-KP
of I-KP
Genocide I-KP

This O
also O
includes O
non O
killings O
that O
in O
the O
end O
eliminate B-KP
the I-KP
group I-KP
, O
such O
as O
preventing B-KP
births I-KP
or O
forcibly O
transferring O
children O
out O
of O
the O
group O
to O
another O
group O
. O

A O
generalized O
meaning O
of O
genocide O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
ordinary O
meaning O
but O
also O
includes O
government O
killings O
of O
political O
opponents O
or O
otherwise O
intentional O
murder O
. O

It O
is O
to O
avoid O
confusion O
regarding O

term O
democide O

the O

Ervin B-KP

showed O
that O
economic O

were O
starting O
points O
of O
increasing O
discrimination O
and O
violence O
in O
many O
instances O
of O
genocides O
and O
mass O
killing O
. O

They O
lead O
to O
scapegoating O
a O
group O
and O
ideologies O
that O
identified O
that O

as O
an O
enemy O
. O

A O
history O

political O
systems O
, O
and O
the O
passivity O
of O
internal O
and O
external O
witnesses O
( O
bystanders O
) O
all O
contribute O
to O
the O
probability O
that O
the O

into O
genocide O
. O

Intense O
conflict O
between O
groups O
that O
is O
unresolved O
, O
becomes O
intractable O

can O
also O
lead O
to O

The O
conditions O

provide O

There O
is O

indicate O
how O
this O
can O
be O
done O

but O
information O

only O
slowly O
transformed O
into O
action O

The O
emergence O
of O
resistance B-KP
of I-KP
bacteria I-KP
to O
antibiotics O
is O
a O
common O
phenomenon O
. O

Emergence O
of O
resistance O
often O
reflects O
evolutionary B-KP
processes I-KP
that O
take O
place O
during O
antibiotic O
therapy O
. O

The O
antibiotic O
treatment O
may O
select O
for O
bacterial O
strains O
with O
physiologically O
or O
genetically O
enhanced O
capacity O
to O
survive B-KP
high I-KP
doses I-KP
of I-KP
antibiotics I-KP
. O

Under O
certain O
conditions O
, O
it O
may O
result O
in O
preferential O
growth O
of O
resistant O
bacteria O
, O
while O
growth O
of O
susceptible O
bacteria O
is O
inhibited O
by O
the O
drug O
. O

For O
example O
, O
antibacterial O
selection O
for O
strains O
having O
previously O
acquired O
antibacterial O
resistance O
genes O
was O
demonstrated O
in O
1943 B-KP
by O
the O
Luria B-KP
Delbr I-KP
ck I-KP
experiment O
. O

Antibiotics O
such O
as O
penicillin B-KP
and I-KP
erythromycin I-KP
, O
which O
used O
to O
have O
a O
high O
efficacy O
against O
many O
bacterial O
species O
and O
strains O
, O
have O
become O
less O
effective O
, O
due O
to O
the O
increased O
resistance O
of O
many O
bacterial O
strains O
. O

The O
successful O
outcome O
of O
antimicrobial O
therapy O
with O
antibacterial O
compounds O
depends O
on O
several O
factors O
. O

These O
include O
host B-KP
defense I-KP
mechanisms I-KP
, I-KP
the I-KP
location I-KP
of I-KP
infection I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
pharmacokinetic I-KP
and I-KP
pharmacodynamic I-KP
properties I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
antibacterial I-KP
. O

A O
bactericidal O
activity O
of O
antibacterials O
may O
depend O
on O
the O
bacterial B-KP
growth I-KP
phase I-KP
, O
and O
it O
often O
requires O
ongoing O
metabolic O
activity O
and O
division B-KP
of I-KP
bacterial I-KP
cells I-KP
. O

These O
findings O
are O
based O
on O
laboratory O
studies O
, O
and O
in O
clinical O
settings O
have O
also O
been O
shown O
to O
eliminate O
bacterial B-KP
infection I-KP
. O

Since O
the O
activity O
of O
antibacterials O
depends O
frequently O
on O
its O
concentration B-KP
, O
in O
vitro O
characterization O
of O
antibacterial O
activity O
commonly O
includes O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
minimum O
inhibitory O
concentration O
and O
minimum O
bactericidal O
concentration O
of O
an O
antibacterial O
. O

To O
predict O
clinical O
outcome O
, O
the O
antimicrobial O
activity O
of O
an O
antibacterial O
is O
usually O
combined O
with O
its O
pharmacokinetic O
profile O

several B-KP

Antibacterial O
antibiotics O
are O
commonly O
classified O

on O
their O
mechanism B-KP

Some O
scientists O
have O
hypothesized O

associated O
with O
increased B-KP
body I-KP

Early B-KP
life I-KP
is O
a O
critical O
period O
for O
the O
establishment O

Mice O

Moreover O
, O
research O

However O
, O
it O
is O
unclear B-KP
whether O

Studies O
have O
found O
a O
correlation O

and O
increased O

at O
10 O

Another O
study O
found O
that O
the O

Therefore O
, O
there O

correlation O

obesity O
in O
humans O
, O
but O
whether O
or O
not O
there O
is O
a O

Although O
there O
is O
a O
correlation O

antibiotic O
use O
in O
early O
life O
and O
obesity O
, O
the O
effect O

weighed B-KP

The B-KP
majority I-KP

indicate I-KP
antibiotics B-KP
do I-KP
interfere I-KP

such O

control O
pills O
, O
such O
as O
for O
the O
broad O

antibacterial O
rifampicin O
, O
these O
cases O
may O
be O
due O
to O
an O
increase O

, O
have O
also O
been O
suggested O
, O
but O
such O
suggestions O
have O
been O
inconclusive B-KP
and I-KP
controversial I-KP
. O

Clinicians O
have O
recommended O
that O
extra B-KP
contraceptive I-KP
measures I-KP
be O
applied O
during O
therapies O
using O
antibacterials O
that O
are O
suspected O
to O
interact O
with O
oral B-KP

Interactions O
between O
alcohol B-KP
and O
certain O
antibiotics O
may O
occur O
and O
may O
cause O
side O
effects O
and O
decreased B-KP
effectiveness I-KP
of I-KP
antibiotic I-KP
therapy I-KP
. O

While O
moderate B-KP
alcohol B-KP
consumption I-KP
is I-KP
unlikely I-KP
to I-KP
interfere I-KP
with I-KP
many I-KP
common I-KP
antibiotics I-KP
, O
there B-KP
are I-KP
specific B-KP
types I-KP

antibiotics I-KP
with I-KP
which I-KP
alcohol I-KP

serious I-KP
side I-KP

. O

Therefore O
, O
potential O
risks O
of O
side O
effects O
and O
effectiveness O
depend O
on O
the O
type O
of O
antibiotic O
administered O

Despite O
the O
lack O

counterindication O
, O
the O
belief O
that O
alcohol B-KP

should I-KP
never I-KP
be I-KP
mixed I-KP
is O
widespread B-KP
. O

Several O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
antibacterial O

exist O
. O

Intrinsic B-KP
antibacterial I-KP
resistance I-KP
may O
be O
part O
of O
the O
genetic O
makeup O
of O
bacterial O
strains O
. O

For O
example O
, O
an O
antibiotic B-KP
target I-KP
may O
be O
absent O
from O
the O
bacterial O
genome O
. O

Acquired O
resistance O
results O
from O
a O
mutation B-KP
in O
the O
bacterial O
chromosome O
or O
the O
acquisition O
of O
extra O
chromosomal O
DNA O

Antibacterial O
producing O
bacteria O
have O
evolved O
resistance O
mechanisms O
that O
have O

to O
be O
similar O
to O
, O
and O
may O
have O
been O
transferred O
to O
, O
antibacterial O
resistant O
strains O
. O

The O
spread O
of O
antibacterial O
resistance O
often O
occurs O
through O
vertical B-KP
transmission I-KP
of I-KP
mutations I-KP
during O
growth O
and O
by O
genetic O
recombination O
of O
DNA O
by O
horizontal O
genetic O
exchange O

For O
instance O
, O
antibacterial B-KP
resistance I-KP
genes I-KP
can O
be O
exchanged O
between O
different O
bacterial O
strains O
or O
species O
via O
plasmids O
that O
carry O
these O
resistance O
genes O
. O

Plasmids O
that O
carry B-KP
several I-KP
different I-KP
resistance I-KP
genes I-KP
can O
confer O
resistance O
to O
multiple O
antibacterials O
. O

Cross O
resistance O
to O
several O
antibacterials O
may O
also O
occur O
when O
a O
resistance O
mechanism O
encoded O
by O
a O
single O
gene O
conveys O
resistance O
to O
more O
than O
one O
antibacterial O
compound O

Antibacterial O
resistant O
strains O
and O
species O
, O
sometimes O
referred O
to O
as O
`` O

Many O
ancient O

More O
recent O
observations O
made O
in O
the O
laboratory O
of O
antibiosis O
between O
microorganisms O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
natural O
antibacterials O
produced O
by O
microorganisms O
. O

Louis O
Pasteur O
observed O
, O
`` O
if O
we O
could O
intervene O
in O
the O
antagonism O
observed O
between O
some O
bacteria O
, O
it O
would O
offer O
perhaps O
the O
greatest O
hopes O
for O

'' O
. O

The O
term O
'antibiosis O
' O
, O
meaning O
`` O
against B-KP
life I-KP
'' O
, O
was O
introduced O
by O
the O
French O
bacteriologist O
Jean B-KP
Paul I-KP
Vuillemin I-KP
as O
a O
descriptive O
name O
of O
the O
phenomenon O
exhibited O
by O
these O
early O
antibacterial O
drugs O
. O

Antibiosis O
was O
first O
described O
in O
1877 O
in O
bacteria O
when O
Louis O
Pasteur O
and O
Robert O
Koch O
observed O
that O
an O
airborne O
bacillus O
could O
inhibit O
the O
growth O
of O
Bacillus O
anthracis O
. O

These O
drugs O
were O
later O
renamed O
antibiotics O
by O
Selman O
Waksman O
, O
an O
American O
microbiologist O
, O
in O
1942 O
. O

Synthetic O
antibiotic O
chemotherapy O
as O
a O
science O
and O
development O
of O
antibacterials O
began O
in O
Germany O
with O
Paul O
Ehrlich O
in O
the O
late O
1880s O
. O

Ehrlich O
noted O
certain O
dyes O
would O
color O
human O
, O
animal O
, O
or O
bacterial O
cells O
, O
whereas O
others O
did O
not O
. O

He O
then O
proposed O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
might O
be O
possible O
to O
create O
chemicals O
that O
would O
act O
as O
a O
selective O
drug O
that O
would O
bind O
to O
and O
kill O
bacteria O
without O
harming O
the O
human O
host O
. O

After O
screening O
hundreds O
of O
dyes O
against O
various O
organisms O
, O
in O
1907 O
, O
he O
discovered O
a O
medicinally O
useful O
drug O
, O
the O
synthetic O
antibacterial O
salvarsan O
now O
called O
arsphenamine O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
some O
types O
of O
mold B-KP
on O
infection O
had O
been O
noticed O
many O
times O
over O
the O
course O
of O
history O
( O
see O
: O
History O
of O
penicillin O
) O
. O

In O
1928 O
, O
Alexander B-KP
Fleming I-KP
noticed O
the O
same O
effect O
in O
a O
Petri O
dish O
, O
where O
a O
number O
of O
disease O
causing O
bacteria O
were O
killed O
by O
a O
fungus O
of O
the O
genus O
Penicillium O
. O

Fleming O
postulated O
that O
the O
effect O
is O
mediated O
by O
an O
antibacterial O
compound O
he O
named O
penicillin B-KP
, O
and O
that O
its O
antibacterial O
properties O
could O
be O
exploited O
for O
chemotherapy B-KP
. O

He O
initially O
characterized O
some O
of O
its O
biological O
properties O
, O
and O
attempted O
to O
use O
a O
crude O
preparation O
to O
treat O
some O
infections O
, O
but O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
pursue O
its O
further O
development O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
trained O
chemists O
. O

The O
first O
sulfonamide O
and O
first O
commercially O
available O
antibacterial O
, O
Prontosil B-KP
, O
was O
developed O
by O
a O
research O
team O
led O
by O
Gerhard B-KP
Domagk I-KP
in O
1932 O
at O
the O
Bayer O
Laboratories O
of O
the O
IG B-KP

Domagk O
received O
the O
1939 B-KP
Nobel I-KP
Prize I-KP
for I-KP
Medicine I-KP
for O
his O
efforts O
. O

Prontosil O
had O
a O
relatively O
broad O
effect O
against O
Gram O
positive O
cocci O
, O
but O
not O
against O
enterobacteria O
. O

Research O
was O
stimulated O
apace O
by O
its O
success O
. O

The O
discovery O
and O
development O
of O
this O
sulfonamide O
drug O
opened O
the O
era O
of O
antibacterials O
. O

In O
1939 B-KP
, O
coinciding O
with O
the O
start B-KP
of I-KP
World I-KP
War I-KP
II I-KP
, I-KP
Rene B-KP
Dubos I-KP
reported O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
first O
naturally O
derived O
antibiotic O
, O
tyrothricin B-KP
, O
a O
compound O
of O
20 O

gramicidin O
and O
80 O

tyrocidine O
, O
from O
B. O

. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
commercially O
manufactured O
antibiotics O
universally O
and O
was O
very O
effective O
in O
treating O
wounds B-KP
and I-KP
ulcers I-KP
during O
World O
War O
II O
. O

Gramicidin O
, O
however O
, O
could O
not O
be O
used O
systemically O
because O
of O
toxicity O
. O

Tyrocidine O
also O
proved O
too O
toxic O
for O
systemic O
usage O
. O

Research O
results O
obtained O
during O
that O
period O
were O
not O
shared O
between O
the O
Axis O
and O
the O
Allied O
powers O
during O

Florey O
and O
Chain O
succeeded O
in O
purifying O
the O
first O
penicillin O
, O
penicillin O
G O
, O
in O
1942 B-KP
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
become O
widely O
available O
outside O
the O
Allied O
military O
before O
1945 B-KP
. O

Later O
, O
Norman B-KP
Heatley I-KP
developed O
the O
back O
extraction O
technique O
for O
efficiently O
purifying O
penicillin O
in O
bulk O
. O

The O
chemical O
structure O
of O
penicillin O
was O
determined O
by O
Dorothy B-KP
Crowfoot I-KP
Hodgkin I-KP
in O
1945 B-KP
. O

Purified O
penicillin O
displayed O
potent O
antibacterial O
activity O
against O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
bacteria O
and O
had O
low O
toxicity O
in O
humans O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
its O
activity O
was O
not O
inhibited O
by O
biological O
constituents O
such O
as O
pus O
, O
unlike O
the O
synthetic O
sulfonamides O
. O

The O
discovery O
of O
such O
a O
powerful O
antibiotic O
was O
unprecedented O
, O
and O
the O
development O
of O
penicillin O
led O
to O
renewed O
interest O
in O
the O
search O
for O
antibiotic O
compounds O
with O
similar O
efficacy O
and O
safety O
. O

For O
their O
successful O
development O
of O
penicillin O
, O
which O
Fleming O
had O
accidentally O
discovered O
but O
could O
not O
develop O
himself O

as O
a O
therapeutic O
drug O
, O
Ernst O
Chain O
and O
Howard O
Florey O
shared O
the O
1945 O
Nobel O
Prize O
in O
Medicine O
with O
Fleming O
. O

Florey O
credited O
Dubos O
with O
pioneering O
the O
approach O
of O
deliberately O
and O
systematically O
searching O
for O
antibacterial O
compounds O
, O
which O
had O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O

Vaccines O
rely O
on O
immune B-KP
modulation I-KP
or I-KP
augmentation I-KP

Vaccination O
either O
excites O
or O
reinforces O
the O
immune O
competence O
of O
a O
host O
to O
ward O
off O
infection O
, O
leading O
to O
the O
activation O
of O

the O
production O
of O

, O

, O
and O
other O
classic O

Antibacterial B-KP
vaccines I-KP
have O
been O
responsible O
for O
a O
drastic O
reduction O
in O
global O
bacterial O
diseases O
. O

Vaccines B-KP
made I-KP
from I-KP
attenuated I-KP
whole I-KP

Phage B-KP
therapy I-KP
is O
another O
option O
that O
is O
being O
looked O
into O
for O
treating O
resistant O
strains O
of O
bacteria O
. O

The O
way O
that O
researchers O
are O
doing O
this O
is O
by O
infecting B-KP
pathogenic I-KP
bacteria I-KP
with O
their O
own O
viruses O
, O
more O
specifically O
, O
bacteriophages O
. O

Bacteriophages O
, O
also O
known O
simply O
as O
phages O
, O
are O
precisely O
bacterial O
viruses O
that O
infect O
bacteria O
by O
disrupting O
pathogenic O
bacterium O
lytic O
cycles O
. O

By O
disrupting O
the O
lytic O
cycles O
of O
bacterium O
, O
phages O
destroy O
their O
metabolism O
, O
which O
eventually O
results O
in O
the O
cell O
's O
death O
. O

Phages O
will O
insert O
their O
DNA O
into O
the O
bacterium O
, O
allowing O
their O
DNA O
to O
be O
transcribed O
. O

Once O
their O
DNA O
is O
transcribed O
the O
cell O
will O
proceed O
to O
make O
new O
phages O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
are O
ready O
to O
be O
released O
, O
the O
cell O
will O
lyse O
. O

One O
of O
the O
worries O
about O
using O
phages O
to O
fight O
pathogens O
is O
that O
the O
phages B-KP
will I-KP
infect I-KP
`` I-KP
good I-KP
'' I-KP
bacteria I-KP
, O
or O
the O
bacteria O
that O
are O
important O
in O
the O
everyday O
function O
of O
human O
beings O
. O

However O
, O
studies O
have O
proven O
that O
phages O
are O
very O
specific O
when O
they O
target O
bacteria O
, O
which O
makes O
researchers O
confident O
that O
bacteriophage O
therapy O
is O
the O
definite O
route O
to O
defeating O
antibiotic O
resistant O
bacteria O
. O

In O
April O
2013 B-KP
, O
the O
Infectious O
Disease O

of O
America O
( O

Since O
2009 O
, O
only O
2 B-KP

The O

the O
Ming O

of O
China O
( O

Analysis O

the O

further O
complicated O

the O
application O

Some O
Mainland B-KP
Chinese I-KP
scholars I-KP

such O
as O
Wang O

Gyaincain O
, O
assert O
that O
the O

full O

renewal O
process O

these O
titles O
that O
involved O
traveling O
to O
the O
Ming O
capital O

Scholars O
within O
China O
also O
argue O
that O
Tibet O
has O
been O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
China O
since O
the O
13th O
century O
and O
that O
it O

a O
part O

such O
as O
Turrell O
V. O

say O
that O
the O
relationship O

one O
of O
suzerainty O

that O

titles O
were O
only O
nominal O
, O
that O
Tibet O
remained O
an O
independent O
region O
outside O

that O
it O
simply O
paid O

Jiajing O
Emperor O

, O
who O

Some O
scholars O
note O
that O
Tibetan O
leaders O

frequently O
engaged O

civil O
war O

conducted O
their O
own O
foreign O
diplomacy O

scholars O
underscore O
the O
commercial O
aspect O

the O
Ming O
Tibetan O
relationship O

noting O
the O

the O

Instead O

However O
, O
the O

Li O

the O

of O
the O
heavily O
censored O
History O
of O

a O
credible O
source O
on O
Sino O
Tibetan B-KP
relations O
is O
questionable O
, O
in O
the O
light O
of O
modern O
scholarship O
. O

Other O
historians O
also O
assert O
that O
these O
Ming O
titles O
were O
nominal O
and O
did O
not O
actually O
confer O
the O
authority O
that O
the O
earlier O

had O
. O

Van O
Praag O
writes O
that O
the O
`` O
numerous O

missions O

are O
referred O
to O
as O
'tributary O

in O
the O
Ming O
Shih O
. O
'' O

Van O
Praag O
writes O
that O
these O
`` O
tributary O
missions O
'' O
were O
simply O
prompted O
by O
China O
's O
need O
for O
horses O
from O
Tibet O
, O
since O
a O
viable O
horse O
market O
in O

lands O
was O
closed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
incessant O
conflict O
. O

Morris B-KP
Rossabi I-KP
also O
writes O
that O
`` O
Tibet O
, O
which O
had O
extensive O
contacts O
with O
China O
during O
the O

, O
scarcely O
had O
diplomatic O

'' O

Historians O
disagree O
on O
what O
the O
relationship O
was O
between O
the O
Ming O
court O
and O
Tibet O
and O
whether O
or O
not O
Ming O
China O
had O
sovereignty O
over O

. O

Van O
Praag O
writes O
that O
Chinese O
court O
historians O
viewed O
Tibet O
as O
an O
independent O
foreign O
tributary O
and O
had O
little O
interest O
in O
Tibet O
besides O
a O
lama O
patron O
relationship O

The O
historian B-KP
Tsepon I-KP
W. I-KP
D. I-KP
Shakabpa I-KP
supports O
van O
Praag O
's O
position O
. O

However O
, O
Wang B-KP
Jiawei I-KP
and I-KP
Nyima I-KP
Gyaincain I-KP
state O
that O
these O
assertions O
by O
van O
Praag O
and O
Shakabpa O
are O
`` O
fallacies O
'' O
. O

Wang B-KP
and I-KP
Nyima I-KP
argue O
that O
the O
Ming O
emperor O
sent O
edicts O
to O
Tibet O
twice O
in O
the O
second O
year O
of O
the O
Ming O
dynasty O
, O
and O
demonstrated O
that O
he O
viewed O
Tibet O
as O
a O
significant O
region O
to O
pacify O
by O
urging O
various O
Tibetan O
tribes O
to O
submit O
to O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
Ming O
court O
. O

They O
note O
that O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Mongol O
Prince O
Punala O
, O
who O
had O
inherited O
his O
position O
as O
ruler O
of O
areas O
of O
Tibet O
, O
went O
to O
Nanjing O
in O
1371 B-KP
to O
pay O
tribute O
and O
show O
his O
allegiance O
to O
the O
Ming O
court O
, O
bringing O
with O
him O
the O
seal O
of O
authority O
issued O
by O
the O
Yuan O
court O
. O

They O
also O
state O
that O
since O
successors O
of O
lamas O
granted O
the O
title O
of O
`` O
prince O
'' O
had O
to O
travel O
to O
the O
Ming O
court O
to O
renew O
this O
title O
, O
and O
since O
lamas O
called O
themselves O
princes B-KP
, O
the O
Ming O
court O
therefore O
had O
`` O
full O
sovereignty O
over O
Tibet O
. O
'' O

They O
state O
that O
the O
Ming O
dynasty O
, O
by O
issuing O
imperial B-KP
edicts I-KP
to O
invite O
ex O
Yuan O
officials O
to O
the O
court O
for O
official O
positions O
in O
the O
early O
years O
of O
its O

won O
submission O
from O

religious O

and O
thereby O
incorporated O

the O
rule O
of O
the O

Thus O
, O
they O
conclude O
, O
the O
Ming O

won O
the O
power O

also O
persuaded O

not O
to O
impose O
his O
military O

on O
Tibet O

the B-KP

Thinley O

Peter O
C. O
Perdue O
says O
that O
Wang O
Anshi O
( O

) O
, O
realizing O
that O
China O
could O
not O
produce O
enough O
militarily O
capable O

, O
had O
also O
aimed O
to O
obtain O
horses O
from O
Inner O
Asia O
in O
exchange O
for O
Chinese O
tea O
. O

The O
Chinese O
needed O
horses O
not O
only O
for O
cavalry O
but O
also O
as O
draft O
animals O
for O
the O
army O
's O
supply O
wagons O
. O

The O
Tibetans O
required O
Chinese O
tea O
not O
only O
as O
a O
common O
beverage O
but O
also O
as O
a O
religious O
ceremonial O
supplement O
. O

The O
Ming O
government O
imposed O
a O
monopoly O
on O
tea O
production O
and O
attempted O
to O
regulate O
this O
trade O
with O
state O
supervised O
markets O
, O
but O
these O
collapsed O
in O
1449 O
due O
to O
military O
failures O
and O
internal O
ecological O
and O
commercial O
pressures O
on O
the O
tea O
producing O
regions O
. O

Van O
Praag O
states O
that O
the B-KP
Ming I-KP
court O
established O
diplomatic O
delegations O
with O
Tibet O
merely O
to B-KP
secure I-KP
urgently I-KP
needed I-KP
horses I-KP
. O

Wang O
and O
Nyima O
argue O
that O
these O
were O
not O
diplomatic O
delegations O
at O
all O
, O
that O
Tibetan O
areas O
were O
ruled O
by O
the O
Ming O
since O
Tibetan O
leaders O
were O
granted O
positions O
as O
Ming O
officials O
, O
that O
horses O
were O
collected O
from O
Tibet O
as O
a B-KP
mandatory I-KP
`` I-KP

'' I-KP

and O
therefore O
Tibetans O
were O
`` O

not O

. O

Sperling O
writes O
that O
the O

simultaneously O
bought O
horses O
in O
the O
Kham O

while O
fighting O
Tibetan O
tribes O
in O
Amdo O
and O
receiving O
Tibetan O
embassies O
in O
Nanjing O
. O

He O
also O
argues O
that O
the O
embassies O
of O
Tibetan O
lamas O
visiting O
the O
Ming O
court O
were O
for O
the O
most O

efforts O
to O

maintained O
a O

faire O
policy O
towards O
Tibet O
and O
limited O
the O
numbers O
of O
the O
Tibetan O
retinues O
, O
the O
Tibetans O
sought O
to O
maintain O
a O
tributary O
relationship O
with O
the O
Ming O
because O
imperial O
patronage O
provided O
them O
with O
wealth O
and O
power O
. O

Laird O
writes O
that O
Tibetans O
eagerly O
sought O
Ming O
court O
invitations O
since O
the O
gifts O
the O
Tibetans O
received O
for O
bringing O
tribute O
were O
much O
greater O
in O

it O
upheld O

Laird O
sees O
as O
an O

to O
`` O

, O
he O
persuaded O
the O
Ming O
to O
reopen O
their O
border O
markets O
in O
1573 O
. O

This O
provided O
the O
Chinese O
with O
a O
new O
supply O
of O
horses O
that O
the O
Mongols O
had O
in O
excess O
; O
it O
was O
also O
a O
relief O
to O

, O
since O
they O
were O

that O

believed O
Altan O
forced O

, O
Chinese O

that O
he O
was O
simply O
a O
loyal O
Chinese O
citizen O

By O
1578 O
, O
Altan O
Khan O
formed O
a O
formidable O
Mongol O

alliance O
with O
the O
Gelug O
that O
the O

Patricia O

writes O
that O
Tibet O
, O
like O
Joseon O

these O

upheld O
close O

However O
, O
there O
were O
instances O
in O
the B-KP
14th I-KP
century I-KP
when O
the O

did O
use O
military O

John O

the O

November B-KP

Langlois O

30,000 B-KP

the B-KP

Norbu O
states O
that O
the O
Ming O
dynasty O
, O
preoccupied O
with O
the O
Mongol O
threat O
to O
the O
north O
, O
could O
not O
spare O
additional O

to O
enforce O
or O
back O
up O
their O
claim O

over O

they O
relied O
on O
`` O

Sperling O
states O
that O
the O
delicate O
relationship O

was O
`` O
the O
last O

'' O
that O
there O
was O
a O
potential O

, O

that O
the O

`` O

P. O
Christiaan O

argues O
that O
the O

patronage O

Historians O

a O
weak O

politically O
fragmented O
Tibet O
after B-KP

Chan O
writes O
that O
this O
was O
perhaps O
the O
calculated O
strategy O
of O
the O
Yongle O
Emperor O
, O
as O
exclusive O
patronage O
to O
one O
Tibetan O
sect O
would O
have O
given O
it O

Sperling O
finds O
no O

sources O
to O
support O
this O
thesis O
of O
Petech O

Norbu O
asserts O
that O
their O
thesis O
is O
largely O
based O
on O
the O
list O

rather O
than O
`` O
comparative O

out O

Despite O
this O
, O
the O
leaders O
of O
Lhasa O
still O
claimed O
their O
allegiance O
to O
the O
Phagmodru O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Gelug O
, O
while O
the O
Tsang O

allied O
with O

Tensions O
rose O
between O

nationalistic O
Tsang O

the O

who O
safeguarded O
their O
Mongol O

in O

The B-KP
fourth I-KP

refused O
to O
give O

Chen O
writes O
of O
the O
speculation O
over O
the O
fourth O
Dalai O

's O
mysterious O
death O
and O
the O
plot O
of O
the O
Tsang O

to O
have O
him O
murdered O
for O
`` O
cursing O
'' O
him O
with O
illness O
, O
although O
Chen O
writes O
that O
the O
murder O
was O
most O
likely O
the O
result O
of O
a O
feudal O
power O
struggle O
. O

In O
1618 O
, O
only O
two O
years O
after O

The O
Tsang O

had O
a O

number O
of O

occupied O
their O
monasteries O
at O
Drepung O

In O

, O
the O
Tsang O

died O
and O
was O
succeeded O
by O
his O
young O

an O

Despite O

, O
made O
efforts O
to O
overthrow O

which O
led O
to O
another O

. O

In O
1633 O
, O
the O
Gelugpas O
and O
several O

Mongol O
adherents O
defeated O
the O

which O
G O

agreed O
upon O
, O
enlisting O
the O

of O

In O
1642 B-KP
, O
after O
a O

the O

his O

in O

Van O
Praag O
writes O
that O
at O
this O
point O
G O
shi O

maintained O
control O
over O
the O
armed O
forces O
, O
but O
accepted O
his O
inferior O

power O
with O

and O
G O

during O
his O
early O
secular O

religious O
reign O
. O

However O
, O
Rawski O
states O
that O
he O
eventually O
`` O
expanded O
his O
own O
authority O
by O
presenting O
himself O
as O

by O
emphasizing O

. O

Goldstein O
states O
that O
the O
government O
of O
G O
shi O
Khan O
and O
the O
Dalai O
Lama O
persecuted O
the O
Karma O
Kagyu O
sect O
, O
confiscated O
their O
wealth O
and O
property O
, O
and O
even O
converted O
their O
monasteries O
into O
Gelug O
monasteries O
. O

Rawski O
writes O
that O
this O
Mongol O
patronage O
allowed O
the O
Gelugpas O
to O
dominate O
the O
rival O
religious O
sects O
in O
Tibet O

Meanwhile O

the O
Chinese O

the O
Han O
Chinese O

China O

states O
that O
when O
the O

replaced O
the O
Ming O
dynasty O
, O
it O
merely O
`` O
strengthened O

However O
, O
Kolma O
states O
that O
the B-KP

was O
very O
observant O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
in O
China O

accepted O
a O
Manchu O
invitation O
in O

Shunzhi O
treated O
the O
Dalai O

as O
an O
independent O
sovereign O
of O

Patterson O

that O
this O
was O
an O

In O
this O

with O
the O

, O
Goldstein O
asserts O
that O
the O
Dalai O

not O
someone O

Digital O
cameras O

found O

with O
the O
introduction O

In O
2006 B-KP
Apple O
presented O
a O
special O
edition O
for O
iPod O
5G O
of O
Irish O
rock O
band O
U2 B-KP
. O

Like O
its O
predecessor O
, O
this O
iPod O
has O
engraved O
the O
signatures O
of O
the O
four O
members O
of O
the O
band O
on O
its O
back O
, O
but O
this O
one O
was O
the O
first O
time O
the O
company O
changed O
the O
colour O
of O
the O
metal O
( O
not O
silver O
but O
black B-KP

. O

This O
iPod O
was O
only O
available O
with O
30GB O
of O
storage O
capacity O
. O

The O
special O
edition O
entitled O
purchasers O
to O
an O
exclusive O

with O
33 O
minutes O
of O
interviews O
and O
performance O
by O

In O
September O
2007 O
, O
during O
a O
lawsuit O
with O
patent O
holding O
company O
Burst.com B-KP
, O
Apple O
drew O
attention O
to O
a O
patent O
for O
a O
similar O
device O
that O
was O
developed O
in O
1979 O
. O

Kane B-KP
Kramer I-KP
applied O
for O
a O
UK B-KP
patent O
for O
his O
design O
of O
a O
`` O
plastic O
music O
box O
'' O
in O
1981 B-KP
, O
which O
he O
called O
the O
IXI B-KP
. O

He O
was O
unable O
to O
secure O
funding O
to O
renew O
the O
US O
$ O
120,000 O
worldwide O
patent O
, O
so O
it O
lapsed O
and O
Kramer O
never O
profited O
from O
his O
idea O
. O

The O
name O
iPod O
was O
proposed O
by O
Vinnie B-KP
Chieco I-KP
, O
a O
freelance B-KP
copywriter I-KP
, O
who O
( O
with O
others O
) O
was O
called O
by O
Apple O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
introduce O
the O
new O
player O
to O
the O
public O
. O

After O
Chieco O
saw O
a O
prototype O
, O
he O
thought O
of O
the O
movie O
2001 B-KP
: I-KP
A I-KP
Space I-KP
Odyssey I-KP
and O
the O
phrase O
`` O
Open O
the O
pod O
bay O
door O
, O
Hal O
! O

`` O
, O
which O
refers O
to O
the O
white O
EVA O
Pods O
of O
the O
Discovery O
One O
spaceship O
. O

Chieco O
saw O
an O
analogy O
to O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
spaceship O
and O
the O
smaller O
independent O
pods O
in O
the O
relationship O
between O
a O
personal O
computer O
and O
the O
music O
player O
. O

Apple O
researched O
the O
trademark O
and O
found O
that O
it O
was O
already O
in O
use O
. O

Joseph B-KP
N. I-KP
Grasso I-KP
of O
New O

had O
originally O
listed O
an O
`` O
iPod O
'' O
trademark O
with O
the O
U.S. O
Patent O
and O
Trademark O
Office O
( O
USPTO O
) O
in O
July O
2000 O
for O
Internet O
kiosks O
. O

The O
first O
iPod O
kiosks O
had O
been O
demonstrated O
to O
the O
public O
in O
New O
Jersey O
in O
March O
1998 O
, O
and O
commercial O
use O
began O
in O
January O
2000 O
, O
but O
had O
apparently O
been O
discontinued O
by O
2001 O
. O

The O
trademark O
was O
registered O
by O
the O
USPTO O
in O
November O
2003 O
, O
and O
Grasso O
assigned O
it O
to O
Apple O
Computer O
, O
Inc. O
in O
2005 B-KP
. O

In O
mid B-KP
2015 I-KP
, O
several O
new O
color O
schemes O
for O
all O
of O
the O
current O
iPod O
models O
were O
spotted O
in O
the O
latest O
version O
of O
iTunes O
, O
12.2 B-KP
. O

Belgian O
website O
Belgium O
iPhone O
originally O
found O
the O
images O
when O
plugging O
in O
an O
iPod O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
and O
subsequent O
leaked O
photos O
were O
found O
by O
Pierre B-KP
Dandumont I-KP
. O

The O
third O
generation O
iPod O
had O
a O
weak B-KP
bass B-KP
response I-KP
, O
as O
shown O
in O
audio O
tests O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
the O
undersized B-KP
DC I-KP
blocking I-KP
capacitors I-KP
and O
the O
typical O
low O
impedance O
of O
most O
consumer O
headphones O
form O
a O
high O
pass O
filter O
, O
which O
attenuates O
the O
low O
frequency O
bass O
output O
. O

Similar O
capacitors O
were O
used O
in O
the O
fourth O
generation O
iPods O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
reduced O
when O
using O
high B-KP
impedance I-KP
headphones O
and O
is O
completely O
masked O
when O
driving O
high O
impedance O
( O
line O
level O
) O
loads O
, O
such O
as O
an O
external B-KP
headphone I-KP
amplifier I-KP
. O

The O
first O
generation O
iPod O
Shuffle O
uses O
a O
dual O
transistor O
output O
stage O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
single O
capacitor O
coupled O
output O
, O
and O
does O
not O
exhibit O
reduced O
bass O
response O
for O
any O
load O
. O

For O
all O
iPods O
released O
in O
2006 B-KP
and O
earlier O
, O
some O
equalizer O
( O
EQ O
) O
sound O
settings O
would O
distort O
the O
bass O
sound O
far O
too O
easily O
, O
even O
on O
undemanding O
songs O
. O

This O
would O
happen O
for O
EQ O
settings O
like O
R B-KP
& I-KP
B I-KP
, I-KP
Rock I-KP
, I-KP
Acoustic I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
Bass I-KP
Booster I-KP
, O
because O
the O
equalizer O
amplified O
the O
digital O
audio O
level O
beyond O
the O
software O
's O
limit O
, O
causing O
distortion O
( O
clipping B-KP
) O
on O
bass O
instruments O
. O

From O
the O
fifth O
generation O
iPod O
on O
, O
Apple O
introduced O
a O
user O
configurable O
volume O
limit O
in O
response O
to O
concerns O
about O
hearing B-KP
loss I-KP
. O

Users O
report O
that O
in O
the O
sixth O
generation O
iPod O
, O
the O
maximum O
volume O
output O
level O
is O
limited O
to O
100 B-KP
dB I-KP
in O
EU B-KP
markets O
. O

Apple O
previously O
had O
to O
remove O
iPods O
from O
shelves O
in O
France B-KP
for O
exceeding O
this O
legal O
limit O
. O

However O
, O
users O
that O
have O
bought O
a O
new O
sixth O
generation O
iPod O
in O
late O
2013 O
have O
reported O
a O
new O
option O
that O
allowed O
them O
to O
disable O
the O
EU O
volume O
limit O
. O

It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
these O
new O
iPods O
came O
with O
an O
updated O
software O
that O
allowed O
this O
change O
. O

Older O
sixth O
generation O
iPods O
, O
however O
, O
are O
unable O
to O
update O
to O
this O
software O
version O
. O

Originally O
, O
a O
FireWire B-KP
connection O
to O
the O
host O
computer O
was O
used O
to O
update O
songs O
or O
recharge O
the O
battery O
. O

The O
battery O
could O
also O
be O
charged O
with O
a O
power B-KP
adapter I-KP
that O
was O
included O
with O
the O
first O
four O
generations O
. O

The O
third B-KP
generation I-KP
began O
including O
a O
30 B-KP
pin I-KP
dock I-KP
connector I-KP
, O
allowing O
for O
FireWire B-KP
or O
USB B-KP
connectivity O
. O

This O
provided O
better O
compatibility O
with O
non O
Apple O
machines O
, O
as O
most O
of O
them O
did O
not O
have O
FireWire O
ports O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Eventually O
Apple O
began O
shipping O
iPods O
with O
USB O
cables O
instead O
of O
FireWire O
, O
although O
the O
latter O
was O
available O
separately O
. O

As O
of O
the O
first O
generation O
iPod O
Nano O
and O
the O
fifth B-KP
generation O
iPod O
Classic O
, O
Apple O
discontinued O
using O
FireWire O
for O
data O
transfer O
( O
while O
still O
allowing O
for O
use O
of O
FireWire O
to O
charge O
the O
device O
) O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
reduce O
cost O
and O
form O
factor O
. O

As O
of O
the O
second O
generation O
iPod O
Touch O
and O
the O
fourth B-KP
generation O
iPod O
Nano O
, O
FireWire O
charging O
ability O
has O
been O
removed O
. O

The O
second O
, O
third O
, O
and O
fourth O
generation O
iPod O
Shuffle B-KP
uses O
a O
single O
3.5 B-KP
mm I-KP
minijack I-KP
phone O
connector O
which O
acts O
as O
both O
a O
headphone O
jack O
and O
a O
data O
port O
for O
the O
dock O
. O

The O
dock B-KP
connector I-KP
also O
allowed O
the O
iPod O
to O
connect O
to O
accessories O
, O
which O
often O
supplement O
the O
iPod O
's O
music O
, O
video O

. O

Apple O
sells O
a O
few O
accessories O
, O
such O
as O
the O
now O
discontinued O

Some O
peripherals O
use O
their O
own O
interface O
, O
while O
others O
use O
the O
iPod O

. O

Because O
the O
dock O
connector O
is O
a O
proprietary O
interface O
, O
the O
implementation O
of O
the O
interface O
requires O
paying B-KP

to O
Apple O
. O

Apple O
introduced O
a O

producer O
Shigeru O
Miyamoto O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
create O
a O
realistic O
Zelda O
game O
that O
would O
appeal O
to O
the O
North O
American O
market O
. O

Miyamoto O
, O
hesitant O
about O
solely O
changing O
the O
game O
's O
presentation O
, O
suggested O
the O
team O
's O
focus O
should O
instead O
be O
on O
coming O
up O
with O
gameplay O
innovations O
. O

He O
advised O
that O
Aonuma O
should O
start O
by O
doing O
what O
could O
not O
be O
done O
in O
Ocarina O
of O
Time O
, O
particularly O
horseback B-KP
combat I-KP
. O

In O
four B-KP

managed O
to O
present O

revealed O
to O
the O
public O
with O
a O
trailer O
at O

The O

in O
2007 O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
Phantom B-KP
Hourglass I-KP
. O

Miyamoto O
explained O
in O
interviews O
that O
the O
graphical O
style O
was O
chosen O
to O
satisfy O
demand O
, O
and O
that O
it O
better O
fit O
the O
theme O
of O
an O
older O
incarnation O
of O
Link O
. O

The O
game O
runs O
on O
a O
modified O
The O
Wind O
Waker O
engine O
. O

Prior O
Zelda O
games O
have O
employed O
a O
theme O
of O
two O
separate O
, O
yet O
connected O
, O
worlds O

In O
A O
Link O
to O
the O

Link O
travels O
between O
a O
`` O
Light O

and O
a O
`` O

in O
Ocarina O

as O
well O
as O
in O
Oracle O
of O
Ages O
, O
Link O
travels O
between O
two O
different O
time O
periods O
. O

The O
Zelda O
team O
sought O
to O
reuse O
this O
motif O
in O
the O
series O
' O
latest O
installment O
. O

It O
was O
suggested O
that O
Link O
transform O
into O
a O
wolf O
, O
much O
like O
he O
metamorphoses O
into O
a O
rabbit B-KP
in O
the O

A O

the O

The O
story O
of O
the O
game O
was O
created O
by O
Aonuma O
, O
and O
later O
underwent O
several O
changes O
by O
scenario O
writers O
Mitsuhiro B-KP
Takano I-KP
and O
Aya O
Kyogoku O
. O

Takano O
created O
the O
script O
for O
the O
story O
scenes O
, O
while O
Kyogoku O
and O
Takayuki O
Ikkaku O
handled O
the O
actual O
in O
game O
script O
. O

Aonuma O
left O
his O
team O
working O
on O
the O
new O
idea O
while O
he O
directed O
The B-KP
Minish I-KP
Cap I-KP
for O
the O
Game O
Boy O

. O

When O
he O
returned O
, O
he O
found O
the O
Twilight O
Princess O
team O
struggling O
. O

Emphasis O
on O
the O
parallel O
worlds O
and O
the O
wolf O
transformation O
had O
made O
Link O
's O
character O
unbelievable O
. O

Aonuma O
also O
felt O
the O
gameplay O
lacked O
the O
caliber O
of O
innovation O
found O
in O
Phantom O
Hourglass O
, O
which O
was O
being O
developed O
with O
touch O
controls O
for O
the O
Nintendo O
DS O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
Wii O
was O
under O
development O
with O
the O
code O
name O
`` O
Revolution B-KP
'' O
. O

Miyamoto B-KP
thought O
that O
the O
Revolution O
's O
pointing O
device O
, O
the O
Wii B-KP
Remote I-KP
, O
was O
well O
suited O
for O
aiming O
arrows O
in O
Zelda O
, O
and O
suggested O
that O
Aonuma O
consider O
using O
it O
. O

[ O
n O
] O

Aonuma O
had O
anticipated O
creating O
a O
Zelda O
game O
for O
what O
would O
later O
be O
called O
the O
Wii O
, O
but O
had O
assumed O
that O
he O
would O
need O
to O
complete O
Twilight O
Princess O
first O
. O

His O
team O
began O
work O
developing O
a O
pointing B-KP
based I-KP
interface O
for O
the O
bow O
and O
arrow O
, O
and O
Aonuma O
found O
that O
aiming O
directly O
at O
the O
screen O
gave O
the O
game O
a O
new O
feel O
, O
just O
like O
the O
DS O
control O
scheme O
for O
Phantom O
Hourglass O
. O

Aonuma O
felt O
confident O
this O
was O
the O
only O
way O
to O
proceed O
, O
but O
worried O
about O
consumers O
who O
had O
been O
anticipating O
a O
GameCube O
release O
. O

Developing O
two O
versions O
would O
mean O
delaying O
the O
previously O
announced O
2005 B-KP
release O
, O
still O
disappointing O
the O
consumer O
. O

Satoru B-KP
Iwata I-KP
felt O
that O
having O
both O
versions O
would O
satisfy O
users O
in O
the O
end O
, O
even O
though O
they O
would O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
the O
finished O
product O
. O

Aonuma O
then O
started O
working O
on O
both O
versions O
in O
parallel O
. O

[ O
o O
] O

Transferring O
GameCube B-KP
development O
to O
the O
Wii B-KP
was O
relatively O
simple O
, O
since O
the O
Wii O
was O
being O
created O
to O
be O
compatible O
with O
the O
GameCube O
. O

[ O
o O
] O
At B-KP
E3 I-KP
2005 I-KP
, O
Nintendo O
released O
a O
small O
number O
of O
Nintendo O
DS O
game O
cards O
containing O
a O
preview O
trailer O
for O
Twilight O
Princess O
. O

They O
also O
announced O
that O
Zelda O
would O
appear O
on O
the O
Wii O
( O
then O
codenamed O
`` O
Revolution O
'' O
) O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
clear O
to O
the O
media O
if O
this O
meant O
Twilight O
Princess O
or O
a O
different O
game O
. O

The O
team O
worked O
on O
a O
Wii O
control O
scheme O
, O
adapting O
camera O
control O
and O
the O
fighting O
mechanics O
to O
the O
new O
interface O
. O

A O
prototype O
was O
created O
that O
used O
a O
swinging B-KP
gesture I-KP
to O
control O
the O
sword O
from O
a O
first O
person O
viewpoint O
, O
but O
was O
unable O
to O
show O
the O
variety O
of O
Link O
's O
movements O
. O

When O
the O
third O
person O
view O
was O
restored O
, O
Aonuma O
thought O
it O
felt O
strange O
to O
swing O
the O
Wii O
Remote O
with O
the O
right O
hand O
to O
control O
the O
sword O
in O
Link O
's O
left O
hand O
, O
so O
the O
entire O
Wii O
version O
map O
was O
mirrored O

Details O
about O
Wii O
controls O
began O
to O
surface O
in O
December O
2005 O
when O
British O
publication O
NGC B-KP
Magazine I-KP
claimed O
that O
when O
a O
GameCube O
copy O
of O
Twilight O
Princess O
was O
played O
on O
the O
Revolution O
, O
it O
would O
give O
the O
player O
the O
option O
of O
using O
the O
Revolution O
controller O
. O

Miyamoto O
confirmed O
the O
Revolution O
controller O
functionality O
in O
an O
interview O
with O
Nintendo O
of O
Europe O
and O
Time O
reported O
this O
soon O
after O
. O

However O
, O
support O
for O
the O
Wii B-KP
controller I-KP
did O
not O
make O
it O
into O
the O
GameCube O
release O
. O

At O
E3 B-KP
2006 I-KP
, O
Nintendo O
announced O
that O
both O
versions O
would O
be O
available O
at O
the O
Wii O
launch O
, O
and O
had O
a O
playable O
version O
of O
Twilight O
Princess O
for O
the O
Wii O
. O

[ O
p O
] O
Later O
, O
the O
GameCube O
release O
was O
pushed O
back O
to O
a B-KP
month I-KP
after O
the O
launch O
of O
the O
Wii O
. O

Nintendo O
staff O
members O
reported O
that O
demo O
users O
complained O
about O
the O
difficulty O
of O
the O
control B-KP
scheme I-KP
. O

Aonuma O
realized O
that O
his O
team O
had O
implemented O
Wii O
controls O
under O
the O
mindset O
of O
`` O
forcing O
'' O
users O
to O
adapt O
, O
instead O
of O
making O
the O
system O
intuitive O
and O
easy O
to O
use O
. O

He O
began O
rethinking O
the O
controls O
with O
Miyamoto O
to O
focus O
on O
comfort B-KP
and I-KP
ease I-KP
. O

[ O
q O
] O
The O
camera O
movement O
was O
reworked O
and O
item O
controls O
were O
changed O
to O
avoid O
accidental O
button O
presses O
. O

[ O
r O
] O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
new O
item O
system O
required O
use O
of O
the O
button O
that O
had O
previously O
been O
used O
for O
the O
sword B-KP
. O

To O
solve O
this O
, O
sword O
controls O
were O
transferred O
back O
to O
gestures O
something O
E3 B-KP
attendees I-KP
had O
commented O
they O
would O
like O
to O
see O
. O

This O
reintroduced O
the O
problem O
of O
using O
a O
right B-KP
handed O
swing O
to O
control O
a O
left O
handed O
sword O
attack O
. O

The O
team O
did O
not O
have O
enough O
time O
before O
release O
to O
rework O
Link O
's O
character O
model O
, O
so O
they O
instead O
flipped O
the O
entire O
game O
everything O
was O
made O
a O
mirror O
image O

[ O

Link O
was O
now O
right O
handed O
, O
and O
references O
to O
`` O
east O
'' O

were O
switched O
around O

The O
GameCube O
version O

however O

was O
left O
with O
the O
original O
orientation O

The O
Twilight O
Princess O

requests O
at O

to O
consider O
using O
orchestral O
music O
for O
the O
other O
tracks O

the O
game O
as O
well O
, O
a O
notion O
reinforced O
by O
his O
preference O

originally O
envisioned O
a O

a O

though O
the O
final O

used O
sequenced O
music O
instead O

Kondo O
later O
cited O
the O
lack O
of O
interactivity O
that O
comes O
with O
orchestral O
music O
as O
one O
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
for O
the O
decision O

pointed O
out O
that O
the O

: O
`` O
If O

In O
the O

many O
local O

the O

explanation O
for O

Some O
attribute O
the O
phenomenon O

the O
end O

changes O

from O

Another O
theory O
is O
that O
widespread O
exposure O

which O
can O
lower O

A O
strong O
correlation O

that O

began O
to O
fall O
after O
lead O
was O

. O

Another O
theory O
cited O
to O
explain O
New O

City O

falling O
homicide O

the O

The O
New O
York O
area O
is O
home O
to O
a O
distinctive O
regional O
speech O
pattern O
called O
the O
New O
York O
dialect O
, O
alternatively O
known O
as O
Brooklynese B-KP
or O
New O
Yorkese O
. O

It O
has O
generally O
been O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
most O
recognizable O
accents O
within O
American O
English O
. O

The O
classic O
version O
of O
this O
dialect O
is O
centered O
on O
middle O
and O
working O
class O
people O
of O
European O
descent O
. O

However O
, O
the O
influx O
of O
non O
European O
immigrants O
in O
recent O
decades O
has O
led O
to O
changes O
in O
this O
distinctive O
dialect O
, O
and O
the O
traditional O
form O
of O
this O
speech O
pattern O
is O
no O
longer O
as O
prevalent O
among O
general O
New O
Yorkers O
as O
in O
the O
past O
. O

The O
traditional O
New O
York O
area O
accent O
is O
characterized O
as O
non O
rhotic O
, O
so O
that O
the O
sound O
[ O
] O
does O
not O
appear O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
syllable O
or O
immediately O
before O
a O
consonant O
; O
hence O
the O
pronunciation O
of O
the O
city O
name O
as O
`` O
New B-KP
Yawk I-KP
. O
'' O

There O
is O
no O
[ O
] O
in O
words O
like O
park O
[ O
p O
k O
] O
or O
[ O
p O
k O
] O
( O
with O
vowel O
backed O
and O
diphthongized O
due O
to O
the O
low O
back O
chain O
shift O
) O
, O
butter O
[ O
b O
] O
, O
or O
here O
[ O
hi O
] O
. O

In O
another O
feature O
called O
the O
low O
back O
chain O
shift O
, O
the O
[ O
] O
vowel O
sound O
of O
words O
like O
talk O
, O
law O
, O
cross O
, O
chocolate O
, O
and O
coffee O
and O
the O
often O
homophonous O
[ O
r O
] O
in O
core O
and O
more O
are O
tensed O
and O
usually O
raised O
more O
than O
in O
General O
American O
. O

In O
the O
most O
old O
fashioned O
and O
extreme O
versions O
of O
the O
New O
York O
dialect O
, O
the O
vowel O
sounds O
of O
words O
like O
`` O
girl O
'' O
and O
of O
words O
like O
`` O
oil O
'' O
became O
a O
diphthong O
[ O
] O
. O

This O
would O
often O
be O
misperceived O
by O
speakers O
of O
other O
accents O
as O
a O
reversal O
of O
the O
er O
and O
oy O
sounds O
, O
so O
that O
girl O
is O
pronounced O
`` O
goil O
'' O
and O
oil O
is O
pronounced O
`` O
erl O
'' O
; O
this O
leads O
to O
the O
caricature O
of O
New O
Yorkers O
saying O
things O
like O
`` O
Joizey O
'' O
( O
Jersey O
) O
, O
`` O
Toidy O
Toid O

'' O
( O
33rd O

`` O

a O
rarely O

on O

time O

In O
1950 B-KP
, O
Lee O
moved O
to O
New O
York O
City O
, O
where O
she O
worked O
as O
a O
reservation B-KP
clerk I-KP
for O
British O
Overseas O
Airways O

; O
there O
, O
she O
began O
writing O
a O
collection O
of O
essays O

short O
stories O
about O
people O
in O
Monroeville O

Hoping O
to O
be O

, O
Lee O
presented O
her O
writing O
in O
1957 O
to O
a O
literary O
agent O
recommended O
by O
Capote O
. O

An O
editor O
at O
J B-KP
. I-KP
B. I-KP
Lippincott O
, O
who O
bought O
the O
manuscript O
, O
advised O
her O
to O
quit O
the O
airline O
and O
concentrate O
on O
writing O
. O

Donations O
from O
friends O
allowed O
her O
to O
write O
uninterrupted O
for O
a O
year O
. O

After O
finishing O
the O
first O
draft O
and O
returning O
it O
to O
Lippincott O
, O
the O
manuscript O
, O
at O
that O
point O
titled O
`` O
Go B-KP
Set I-KP
a I-KP
Watchman I-KP
'' O
, O
fell O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
Therese B-KP
von I-KP
Hohoff I-KP
Torrey I-KP
known O
professionally O
as O
Tay B-KP
Hohoff I-KP
a O
small O
, O
wiry O
veteran O
editor O
in O
her O
late O
50s O
. O

Hohoff O
was O
impressed O
. O

[ O
T O
] O
he O
spark O
of O
the O
true O
writer O
flashed O
in O
every O
line O
, O
she O
would O
later O
recount O
in O
a O
corporate O
history O
of O
Lippincott O
. O

But O
as O
Hohoff O
saw O
it O
, O
the O
manuscript O
was O
by O
no O
means O
fit O
for O
publication O
. O

It O
was O
, O
as O
she O
described O
it O
, O
more O
a O
series O
of O
anecdotes O
than O
a O
fully O
conceived O
novel O
. O

During O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
she O
led O
Lee O
from O
one O
draft O
to O
the O
next O
until O
the O
book O
finally O
achieved O
its O
finished O
form O
and O
was O
retitled O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
. O

Lee O
had O
lost O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
suffered O
from O
mental B-KP
illness I-KP
, O
six O
years O
before O
she O
met O
Hohoff O
at O
Lippincott O

offices O
. O

Her B-KP
father I-KP
, O
a O
lawyer B-KP
on O
whom O
Atticus O
was O
modeled O
, O
would O
die O
two O
years O
after O
the O
publication O
of O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
. O

Ultimately O
, O
Lee O
spent O
over B-KP
two I-KP
and I-KP
a I-KP
half I-KP
years I-KP
writing O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
. O

The O
book O
was O
published O
on O
July B-KP

After O
rejecting O
the O
`` O
Watchman O
'' O
title O
, O
it O
was O
initially O
re O
titled O
Atticus O
, O
but O
Lee O
renamed O
it O
`` O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
'' O
to O
reflect O
that O
the O
story O
went O
beyond O
just O
a O
character O
portrait O
. O

The O
editorial O
team O
at O
Lippincott O
warned O
Lee O
that O
she O
would O
probably O
sell O
only O
several O
thousand O
copies O
. O

In O
1964 O
, O
Lee O
recalled O
her O
hopes O
for O
the O
book O
when O
she O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
never O
expected O
any O
sort O
of O
success O
with O

... O

I O
was O
hoping O
for O
a O
quick O
and O
merciful O
death O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
reviewers O
but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
I O
sort O
of O
hoped O
someone O
would O
like O
it O
enough O
to O
give O
me O
encouragement O
. O

Public O
encouragement O
. O

I O
hoped O
for O
a O
little O
, O
as O
I O
said O
, O
but O
I O
got O
rather O
a O
whole O
lot O
, O
and O
in O
some O
ways O
this O
was O
just O
about O
as O
frightening O
as O
the O
quick O
, O
merciful O
death O
I O
'd O
expected O
. O

immediately O

Since O
the O
original O

the O
book O

The O
story O
takes O
place O
during O
three B-KP
years O
( O
1933 O
35 O
) O
of O
the B-KP
Great I-KP
Depression I-KP

town O
'' O
of O
Maycomb B-KP
, I-KP
Alabama I-KP
, O
the O
seat O
of O
Maycomb O
County O
. O

It O
focuses O
on O
six O
year O
old O
Jean B-KP
Louise I-KP
Finch I-KP
( I-KP
Scout I-KP
) I-KP
, O
who O
lives O
with O
her O

brother O

and O
their O
widowed O
father O

Atticus O
, O
a O

Jem O
and O
Scout O
befriend O
a O
boy O
named O
Dill B-KP
, O
who O
visits O
Maycomb O
to O
stay O
with O
his O
aunt O
each O
summer O
. O

The O
three O
children O
are O
terrified O
of O
, O
and O
fascinated O
by O
, O
their O
neighbor O
, O
the O
reclusive O
Arthur O
`` O
Boo O
'' O
Radley O
. O

The O
adults O
of O
Maycomb O
are O
hesitant O
to O
talk O
about O
Boo O
, O
and O
, O
for O
many O
years O
few O
have O
seen O
him O
. O

The O
children O
feed O
one O
another O
's O
imagination O
with O
rumors O
about O
his O
appearance O
and O
reasons O
for O
remaining O
hidden O
, O
and O
they O
fantasize O
about O
how O
to O
get O
him O
out O
of O
his O
house O
. O

After O
two B-KP
summers O
of O
friendship O
with O
Dill O
, O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
find O
that O
someone O
leaves O
them O
small O
gifts O
in O
a O
tree O
outside O
the O
Radley O
place O
. O

Several O
times O
the O
mysterious O
Boo O
makes O
gestures O
of O
affection O
to O
the O
children O
, O
but O
, O
to O
their O
disappointment O
, O
he O
never O
appears O
in O
person O
. O

Judge O
Taylor O
appoints O
Atticus O
to O
defend O
Tom B-KP
Robinson I-KP
, O
a O
black O
man O
who O
has O
been O
accused O
of O
raping O
a O
young O
white O
woman O
, O
Mayella B-KP
Ewell I-KP
. O

Although O
many O
of O
Maycomb O
's O
citizens O
disapprove O
, O
Atticus O
agrees O
to O
defend O
Tom O
to O
the O
best O
of O
his O
ability O
. O

Other O
children O
taunt O
Jem O
and O
Scout O
for O
Atticus O
's O
actions O
, O
calling O
him O
a O
`` O
nigger O
lover O
'' O
. O

Scout O
is O
tempted O
to O
stand O
up O
for O
her O
father O
's O
honor O
by O
fighting O
, O
even O
though O
he O
has O
told O
her O
not O
to O
. O

Atticus O
faces O
a O
group O
of O
men O
intent O
on O
lynching O
Tom O
. O

This O
danger O
is O
averted O
when O
Scout B-KP
, I-KP
Jem I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
Dill I-KP
shame O
the O
mob O
into O
dispersing O
by O
forcing O
them O
to O
view O
the O
situation O
from O
Atticus O
' O
and O
Tom O
's O
points O
of O
view O
. O

Atticus O
does O
not O
want O
Jem B-KP
and I-KP
Scout I-KP
to O
be O
present O
at O
Tom O
Robinson O
's O
trial O
. O

No O
seat O
is O
available O
on O
the O
main O
floor O
, O
so O
by O
invitation O
of O
Rev O
. O

Sykes O
, O
Jem O
, O
Scout O
, O
and O
Dill O
watch O
from O
the B-KP
colored I-KP
balcony I-KP
. O

Atticus O
establishes O
that O
the O
accusers O
Mayella O
and O
her O
father O
, O
Bob O
Ewell O
, O
the O
town O
drunk O
are O
lying O
. O

It O
also O
becomes O
clear O
that O
the O
friendless O
Mayella O
made O
sexual O
advances O
toward O
Tom O
, O
and O
that O
her O
father O
caught O
her O
and O
beat O
her O
. O

Despite O
significant O
evidence O
of O
Tom O
's O
innocence O
, O
the O
jury O
convicts O
him O
. O

Jem O
's O
faith O
in O
justice O
becomes O
badly O
shaken O
, O
as O
is O
Atticus O
' O
, O
when O
the O
hapless O
Tom O
is O
shot B-KP
and I-KP
killed I-KP
while O
trying O
to O
escape O
from O
prison O
. O

Despite O
Tom O
's O
conviction O
, O
Bob B-KP
Ewell I-KP
is O
humiliated O
by O
the O
events O
of O
the O
trial O
, O
Atticus O
explaining O
that O
he O
`` O
destroyed O
[ O
Ewell O
's O
] O
last O
shred O
of O
credibility O
at O
that O
trial O
. O
'' O

Ewell O
vows O
revenge O
, O
spitting O
in O
Atticus O
' O
face O
, O
trying O
to O
break O
into O
the O
judge O
's O
house O
, O
and O
menacing O
Tom O
Robinson O
's O
widow O
. O

Finally O
, O
he O
attacks O
the O
defenseless O
Jem B-KP
and I-KP
Scout I-KP
while O
they O
walk O
home O
on O
a O
dark O
night O
after O
the O
school O
Halloween B-KP
pageant I-KP
. O

One O
of O
Jem O
's O
arms O
is O
broken O
in O
the O
struggle O
, O
but O
amid O
the O
confusion O
someone O
comes O
to O
the O
children O
's O
rescue O
. O

The O
mysterious O
man O
carries O
Jem O
home O
, O
where O
Scout O
realizes O
that O
he O
is O
Boo B-KP
Radley I-KP
. O

Sheriff B-KP
Tate I-KP
arrives O
and O
discovers O
that O
Bob O
Ewell O
has O
died O
during O
the O
fight O
. O

The O
sheriff O
argues O
with O
Atticus O
about O
the O
prudence O
and O
ethics O
of O
charging O
Jem O
( O
whom O
Atticus O
believes O
to O
be O
responsible O
) O
or O
Boo O
( O
whom O
Tate O
believes O
to O
be O
responsible O
) O
. O

Atticus O
eventually O
accepts O
the O
sheriff O
's O
story O
that O
Ewell O
simply O
fell B-KP
on I-KP
his I-KP
own I-KP
knife I-KP
. O

Boo O
asks O
Scout O
to O
walk O
him O
home O
, O
and O
after O
she O
says O
goodbye O
to O
him O
at O
his O
front O
door O
he O
disappears O
again O
. O

While O
standing O
on O
the O
Radley O
porch O
, O
Scout O
imagines O
life O
from O
Boo O
's O
perspective O
, O
and O
regrets O
that O
they O
had O
never O
repaid O
him O
for O
the O
gifts O
he O
had O
given O
them O
. O

Lee O
has O
said O
that O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
is O
not O
an O
autobiography B-KP
, O
but O
rather O
an O
example O
of O
how O
an O
author O
`` O
should O
write O
about O
what O
he O
knows O
and O
write O
truthfully O
'' O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
several O
people O
and O
events O
from O
Lee O
's O
childhood O
parallel O
those O
of O
the O
fictional O
Scout O
. O

Lee O
's O
father O
, O
Amasa O
Coleman O
Lee O
, O
was O
an O
attorney O
, O
similar O
to O
Atticus O
Finch O
, O
and O
in O
1919 B-KP
, O
he O
defended O
two O
black O
men O
accused O
of O
murder O
. O

After O
they O
were O
convicted O
, O
hanged O
and O
mutilated O
, O
he O
never O
tried O
another O
criminal O
case O
. O

Lee O
's O
father O
was O
also O
the O
editor B-KP
and I-KP
publisher I-KP
of O
the O
Monroeville O
newspaper O
. O

Although O
more O
of O
a O
proponent O
of O
racial O
segregation O
than O
Atticus O
, O
he O
gradually O
became O
more O
liberal O
in O
his O
later O
years O
. O

Though O
Scout O
's O
mother O
died O
when O
she O
was O
a O
baby O
, O
Lee O
was O
25 B-KP
when O
her O
mother O
, O
Frances O
Cunningham O
Finch O
, O
died O
. O

Lee O
's O
mother O
was O
prone O
to O
a O
nervous O
condition O
that O
rendered O
her O
mentally O
and O
emotionally O
absent O
. O

Lee O
had O
a O
brother O
named O
Edwin O
, O
who O
like O
the O
fictional O
Jem O
was O
four O
years O
older O
than O
his O
sister O
. O

As O
in O
the O
novel O
, O
a O
black O
housekeeper O
came O
daily O
to O
care O
for O
the O
Lee O
house O
and O
family O
. O

Lee O
modeled O
the O
character O
of O
Dill O
on O
her O
childhood O
friend O
, O
Truman B-KP
Capote I-KP
, O
known O
then O
as O
Truman O
Persons O
. O

Just O
as O
Dill O
lived O
next B-KP
door I-KP
to O
Scout O
during O
the O
summer O
, O
Capote O
lived O
next O
door O
to O
Lee O
with O
his O
aunts O
while O
his O
mother O
visited O
New O
York O
City O
. O

Like O
Dill O
, O
Capote O
had O
an O
impressive O
imagination O
and O
a O
gift O
for O
fascinating O
stories O
. O

Both O
Lee O
and O
Capote O
were O
atypical O
children O
: O
both O
loved O
to O
read O
. O

Lee O
was O
a O
scrappy O
tomboy O
who O
was O
quick O
to O
fight O
, O
but O
Capote O
was O
ridiculed O
for O
his O
advanced O
vocabulary O
and O
lisp O
. O

She O
and O
Capote O
made O
up O
and O
acted O
out O
stories O
they O
wrote O
on O
an O
old B-KP
Underwood I-KP
typewriter I-KP
Lee O
's O
father O
gave O
them O
. O

They O
became O
good O
friends O
when O
both O
felt O
alienated O
from O
their O
peers O
; O
Capote O
called O
the O
two O
of O
them O
`` O
apart B-KP
people I-KP
'' O
. O

In O
1960 B-KP
, O
Capote O
and O
Lee O
traveled O
to O
Kansas O
together O
to O
investigate O
the O
multiple O
murders O
that O
were O
the O
basis O
for O
Capote O
's O
nonfiction O
novel O
In B-KP
Cold I-KP
Blood I-KP
. O

The O
origin O
of O
Tom O
Robinson O
is O
less O
clear O
, O
although O
many O
have O
speculated O
that O
his O
character O
was O
inspired O
by O
several O
models O
. O

When O
Lee O
was O
10 B-KP
years O
old O
, O
a O
white O
woman O
near O
Monroeville O
accused O
a O
black O
man O
named O
Walter B-KP
Lett I-KP
of O
raping O
her O
. O

The O
story O
and O
the O
trial O
were O
covered O
by O
her O
father O
's O
newspaper O
which O
reported O
that O
Lett O
was O
convicted O
and O
sentenced O
to O
death O
. O

After O
a O
series O
of O
letters O
appeared O
claiming O
Lett O
had O
been O
falsely O
accused O
, O
his O
sentence O
was O
commuted O
to O
life O
in O
prison O
. O

He O
died O
there O
of O
tuberculosis O
in O
1937 O
. O

Scholars O
believe O
that O
Robinson O
's O
difficulties O
reflect O
the O
notorious O
case O
of O
the O
Scottsboro O
Boys O
, O
in O
which O
nine O
black O
men O
were O
convicted O
of O
raping O
two O
white O
women O
on O
negligible O
evidence O
. O

However O
, O
in O
2005 O
, O
Lee O
stated O
that O
she O
had O
in O
mind O
something O
less O
sensational O
, O
although O
the O
Scottsboro O
case O
served O
`` O
the O
same O
purpose O
'' O
to O
display B-KP
Southern I-KP
prejudices I-KP
. O

Emmett B-KP
Till I-KP
, O
a O
black O
teenager O
who O
was O
murdered O
for O
flirting O
with O
a O
white O
woman O
in O
Mississippi O
in O
1955 O
, O
and O
whose O
death O
is O
credited O
as O
a O
catalyst O
for O
the O
Civil B-KP
Rights I-KP
Movement I-KP
, O
is O
also O
considered O
a O
model O
for O
Tom O
Robinson O
. O

Writing O
about O
Lee O

style O
and O
use O
of O
humor O
in O
a O
tragic O
story O
, O
scholar O
Jacqueline O
Tavernier O

states O
: O

Scout O

precocious O
observations O
about O
her O
neighbors O
and O
behavior O
inspire O
National O

director O
David O
Kipen O
to O
call O
her O
`` O

To O
address O
complex O
issues O
, O
however O
, O
Tavernier O
Courbin O
notes O
that O
Lee O
uses O
parody B-KP
, I-KP
satire I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
irony I-KP
effectively O
by O
using O
a O
child O
's O
perspective O

After O
Dill O
promises O
to O
marry O
her O
, O
then O
spends O
too O
much O
time O
with O
Jem O
, O
Scout O
reasons O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
him O
to O
pay O
attention O
to O
her O
is O
to O
beat O
him O
up O
, O
which O
she O
does O
several O
times O
. O

Scout O
's O
first O
day O
in O
school O
is O
a O
satirical O
treatment O
of O
education O
; O
her O
teacher O
says O
she O
must O
undo O
the O
damage O
Atticus O
has O
wrought O
in O
teaching O
her O
to O
read O
and O
write O
, O
and O
forbids O
Atticus O
from O
teaching O
her O
further O
. O

Lee O
treats O
the O
most O
unfunny O
situations O
with O
irony O
, O
however O
, O
as O
Jem O
and O
Scout O
try O
to O
understand O
how O
Maycomb O
embraces O
racism O
and O
still O
tries O
sincerely O
to O
remain O
a O
decent O
society O
. O

Satire B-KP
and I-KP
irony I-KP
are O
used O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
Tavernier O
Courbin O
suggests O
one O
interpretation O
for O
the O
book O
's O
title O
: O
Lee O
is O
doing O
the O
mocking O
of O
education O
, O
the O
justice O
system O
, O
and O
her O
own O
society O
by O
using O
them O
as O
subjects O
of O
her O
humorous O
disapproval O
. O

Critics O
also O
note O
the O
entertaining O
methods O
used O
to O
drive O
the O
plot O
. O

When O
Atticus O
is O
out O
of O
town O
, O

locks O
a O
Sunday O
school O
classmate O
in O
the O
church B-KP

with O
the O

This O
prompts O
their O
black O
housekeeper O
Calpurnia B-KP
to O
escort O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
to O
her O
church O

allows O
the O
children O

glimpse O

her O
personal O
life O

as O
well O
as O

she O

Scholars O
have O
characterized O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
as O
both O
a O
Southern B-KP
Gothic B-KP
and I-KP
coming I-KP
of I-KP
age I-KP

Bildungsroman I-KP
novel I-KP
. O

The O
grotesque O
and O
near O
supernatural O
qualities O
of O
Boo O
Radley O
and O
his O
house O
, O
and O
the O
element O
of O
racial O
injustice O
involving O
Tom O
Robinson O
contribute O
to O
the O
aura O
of O
the O
Gothic O
in O
the O
novel O
. O

Lee O
used O
the O
term O
`` O
Gothic O
'' O
to O
describe O
the O
architecture O
of O
Maycomb O
's O
courthouse O
and O
in O
regard O
to O
Dill O
's O
exaggeratedly O
morbid O
performances O
as O
Boo O
Radley O
. O

Outsiders O
are O
also O
an O
important O
element O
of O
Southern O
Gothic O
texts O
and O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
's O
questions O
about O
the O
hierarchy O
in O
the O
town O
cause O
scholars O
to O
compare O
the O
novel O
to O
Catcher O
in O
the O
Rye O
and O
Adventures O
of O
Huckleberry O
Finn O
. O

Despite O
challenging O
the O
town O
's O
systems O
, O
Scout O
reveres O
Atticus B-KP
as O
an O
authority O
above O
all O
others O
, O
because O
he O
believes O
that O
following O
one O
's O
conscience O
is O
the O
highest O
priority O
, O
even O
when O
the O
result O
is O
social O
ostracism O
. O

However O
, O
scholars O
debate O
about O
the O
Southern O
Gothic O
classification O
, O
noting O
that O
Boo O
Radley O
is O
in O
fact O
human O
, O
protective O
, O
and O
benevolent O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
in O
addressing O
themes O
such O
as O
alcoholism O
, O
incest O
, O
rape O
, O
and O
racial O
violence O
, O
Lee O
wrote O
about O
her O
small O
town O
realistically O
rather O
than O
melodramatically O
. O

She O
portrays O
the O
problems O
of O
individual O
characters O
as O
universal O
underlying O
issues O
in O
every O
society O
. O

As O
children O
coming O
of O
age O
, O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
face O
hard O
realities O
and O
learn O
from O
them O
. O

Lee O
seems O
to O
examine O
Jem O
's O
sense O
of O
loss O
about O
how O
his O
neighbors O
have O
disappointed O
him O
more O
than O
Scout O
's O
. O

Jem O
says O
to O
their O
neighbor O
Miss B-KP
Maudie I-KP
the O
day O
after O
the O
trial O
, O
`` O
It O
's O

that O

This O
leads O
him O
to O
struggle O
with O
understanding O
the O
separations B-KP
of I-KP
race I-KP
and I-KP
class I-KP

Just O
as O
the O
novel O
is O
an O
illustration O
of O
the O
changes O
Jem O
faces O
, O
it O
is O
also O
an O
exploration O
of O
the O
realities O
Scout O
must O
face O
as O
an O
atypical O
girl O
on O
the O
verge O
of O
womanhood O

As O
one O
scholar O
writes O
, O
`` O
To O
Kill O
a O

can O
be O
read O
as O
a O
feminist O

for O

from O
her O
childhood O

The O
second O
part O
of O
the O
novel O
deals O
with O
what O
book O
reviewer O
Harding O
LeMay O
termed O
`` O
the O
spirit O
corroding O
shame O
of O
the O
civilized O

treatment O
of O

'' O
. O

In O
the O
years O
following O
its O
release O
, O
many O
reviewers O
considered O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
a O
novel O
primarily O
concerned O
with O
race B-KP
relations I-KP
. O

Claudia O
Durst O
Johnson O
considers O
it O
`` O
reasonable O
to O
believe O
'' O
that O
the O
novel O
was O
shaped O
by O
two O
events O
involving O
racial O
issues O
in O
Alabama O
: O
Rosa O
Parks O
' O
refusal O
to O
yield O
her O
seat O
on O
a O
city O
bus O
to O
a O
white O
person O
, O
which O
sparked O
the O
1955 B-KP
Montgomery O
Bus O
Boycott O
, O
and O
the O
1956 O
riots O
at O
the O
University O
of O
Alabama O
after O
Autherine O
Lucy O

Polly O
Myers O
were O
admitted O
( O
Myers O
eventually O
withdrew O
her O
application O
and O
Lucy O
was O
expelled O
, O
but O
reinstated O
in O
1980 O

In O
writing O
about O
the O
historical O
context O
of O
the O
novel O
's O
construction O
, O
two O
other O
literary O
scholars O
remark O
: O
`` O
To O

in O
the O
South O
since O
the O
Civil O
War O
and O

Inevitably O
, O
despite O
its O
mid O
1930s O
setting O
, O
the O
story O
told O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O

Scholar O
Patrick O
Chura O
, O
who O
suggests O
Emmett O
Till O
was O
a O
model O
for O
Tom O
Robinson O
, O
enumerates O
the O
injustices O
endured O
by O
the O
fictional O
Tom O
that O
Till O
also O
faced O
. O

Chura O
notes O
the O
icon O
of O
the O
black O
rapist O
causing O
harm O
to O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
`` O
mythologized O
vulnerable O
and O
sacred O
Southern O
womanhood O
'' O
. O

Any O
transgressions O
by O
black O
males O
that O
merely O
hinted O
at O
sexual O
contact O
with O
white B-KP
females O
during O
the O
time O
the O
novel O
was O
set O
often O
resulted O
in O
a O
punishment O
of O
death B-KP
for O
the O
accused O
. O

Tom O
Robinson O
's O
trial O
was O
juried O
by O
poor B-KP
white I-KP
farmers I-KP
who O
convicted O
him O
despite O
overwhelming O
evidence O
of O
his O
innocence O
, O
as O
more O
educated O
and O
moderate O
white O
townspeople O
supported O
the O
jury O
's O
decision O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
victim O
of O
racial O
injustice O
in O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
was O
physically O
impaired O
, O
which O
made O
him O
unable O
to O
commit O
the O
act O
he O
was O
accused O
of O
, O
but O
also O
crippled O
him O
in O
other O
ways O
. O

Roslyn O
Siegel O
includes O
Tom O
Robinson O
as O
an O
example O
of O
the O
recurring O
motif O
among O
white O
Southern O
writers O
of O
the O
black O
man O
as O
`` O
stupid O
, O
pathetic O
, O
defenseless O
, O
and O
dependent O
upon O
the O
fair O
dealing O
of O
the O
whites O
, O
rather O
than O
his O
own O
intelligence O
to O
save O
him O
'' O
. O

Although O
Tom O
is O
spared O
from O
being O
lynched O
, O
he O
is O
killed O
with O
excessive O
violence O
during O
an O
attempted O
escape O
from O
prison O
, O
shot B-KP
seventeen B-KP
times I-KP
. O

The O
theme O
of O
racial O
injustice O
appears O
symbolically O
in O
the O
novel O
as O
well O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Atticus O
must O
shoot O
a B-KP
rabid I-KP
dog I-KP
, O
even O
though O
it O
is O
not O
his O
job O
to O
do O
so O
. O

Carolyn O
Jones O
argues O
that O
the O
dog O
represents O
prejudice O
within O
the O
town O
of O
Maycomb O
, O
and O
Atticus O
, O
who O
waits O
on O
a O
deserted O
street O
to O
shoot O
the O
dog O
, O
must O
fight B-KP
against I-KP
the I-KP
town I-KP
's I-KP
racism I-KP
without O
help O
from O
other O
white O
citizens O
. O

He O
is O
also O
alone O
when O
he O
faces O
a O
group O
intending O
to O
lynch O
Tom O
Robinson O
and O
once O
more O
in O
the O
courthouse O
during O
Tom O
's O
trial O
. O

Lee O
even O
uses O
dreamlike O
imagery O
from O
the O
mad O
dog O
incident O
to O
describe O
some O
of O
the O
courtroom O
scenes O
. O

Jones O
writes O
, O
`` O

Civil O

Andrew O
Young O
comments O
that O
part O
of O
the O

effectiveness O
is O
that O
it O
`` O

by O
using O

the O

it O

set O

Young O
views O
the O
novel O
as O
`` O
an O
act O

in O
showing O
the O
possibility O
of O

a O
book O
that O
is O

Childress O
states O
the O

not O

I O
think O
the O

really O
helped O
them O
come O
to O
understand O
what O
was O
wrong O

the O
system O

the O
way O
that O
any O
number O
of O

could O
never O
do O

because O
it O

Lee O

An O

draft O
of O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
, O
titled O
Go B-KP
Set I-KP

Watchman I-KP

was O
controversially O
released O
on O
July B-KP

2015 B-KP

This O
draft O
, O
which O
was O
completed O
in O
1957 B-KP
, O
is O
set O
20 O
years O
after O
the O
time O
period O
depicted O
in O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
but O
is O
not O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
narrative O
. O

This O
earlier O
version O
of O
the O
story O
follows O
an O
adult O
Scout O
Finch O
who O
travels O
from O
New O
York O
to O
visit O
her O
father O
, O
Atticus O
Finch O

in O
Maycomb O

where O
she O
is O
confronted O
by O
the O
intolerance O
in O
her O
community O

The O
Watchman O
manuscript O
was O
believed O
to O
have O
been O
lost O
until O
Lee O
's O
lawyer O
Tonja B-KP
Carter I-KP
discovered O
it O
; O
although O
this O
claim O
has O
been O
widely O
disputed O
. O

Watchman O
contains O
early O
versions O
of O
many O
of O
the O
characters O
from O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
. O

According O
to O
Lee O
's O
agent O
Andrew O
Nurnberg O
, O
Mockingbird O
was O
originally O
intended O
to O
be O
the O
first O
book O
of O
a O
trilogy O
: O
`` O
They O
discussed O
publishing O
Mockingbird O
first O
, O
Watchman O
last O
, O
and O
a O
shorter O
connecting O
novel O
between O
the O
two O
. O
'' O

This O
assertion O
has O
been O
discredited O
however O
by O
the O
rare O
books O
expert O
James O
S. O
Jaffe O
, O
who O
reviewed O
the O
pages O
at O
the O
request O
of O
Lee O
's O
attorney O
and O
found O
them O
to O
be O
only O
another O
draft O
of O
`` O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
'' O
. O

The O
statement O
was O
also O
contrary O
to O
Jonathan O
Mahler O
's O
description O
of O
how O
`` O
Watchman O
'' O
was O
seen O
as O
just O
the O
first O
draft O
of O
`` O
Mockingbird O
'' O

Instances O
where O
many O
passages O
overlap O
between O
the O
two O
books O
, O
in O
some O
case O
word O
for O
word O
, O
also O
refutes O
this O
assertion O
. O

The O
novel O
is O
renowned O
for O
its O
warmth O
and O
humor O
, O
despite O
dealing O
with O
the O
serious O
issues O
of O
rape B-KP
and I-KP
racial I-KP
inequality I-KP
. O

The O
narrator O
's O
father O
, O
Atticus B-KP
Finch I-KP
, O
has O
served O
as O
a O
moral O
hero O
for O
many O
readers O
and O
as O
a O
model O
of O
integrity O
for O
lawyers O
. O

One O
critic O
explains O
the O
novel O
's O
impact O
by O
writing O
, O
`` O
In O
the O
twentieth O
century O
, O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
is O
probably O
the O
most O
widely O
read O
book O
dealing O
with O
race O
in O
America O
, O
and O
its O
protagonist O
, O
Atticus O
Finch O
, O
the O
most O
enduring O
fictional O
image O
of O
racial O
heroism O
. O
'' O

The O
strongest O
element O
of O
style O
noted O
by O
critics O
and O
reviewers O
is O
Lee O
's O
talent O
for O
narration B-KP
, O
which O
in O
an O
early O
review O
in O
Time O
was O
called O
`` O
tactile O
brilliance O
'' O
. O

Writing O
a O
decade O
later O
, O
another O
scholar O
noted O
, O
`` O
Harper O
Lee O
has O
a O
remarkable O
gift O
of O
story O
telling O
. O

Her O
art O
is O
visual O
, O
and O
with O
cinematographic O
fluidity O
and O
subtlety O
we O
see O
a O
scene O
melting O
into O
another O
scene O
without O
jolts O
of O
transition O
. O
'' O

Lee O
combines O
the O
narrator O
's O
voice O
of O
a O
child O
observing O
her O
surroundings O
with O
a O
grown O
woman O
's O
reflecting O
on O
her O
childhood O
, O
using O
the O
ambiguity O
of O
this O
voice O
combined O
with O
the O
narrative O
technique O
of O
flashback B-KP
to O
play O
intricately O
with O
perspectives O
. O

This O
narrative O
method O
allows O
Lee O
to O
tell O
a O
`` O
delightfully O
deceptive O
'' O
story O
that O
mixes O
the O
simplicity O
of O
childhood O
observation O
with O
adult O
situations O
complicated O
by O
hidden O
motivations O
and O
unquestioned O
tradition O
. O

However O
, O
at O
times O
the O
blending O
causes O
reviewers O
to O
question O
Scout O
's O
preternatural O
vocabulary O
and O
depth O
of O
understanding O
. O

Both O
Harding O
LeMay O
and O
the O
novelist O
and O
literary O
critic O
Granville O
Hicks O
expressed O
doubt O
that O
children O
as O
sheltered O
as O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
could O
understand O
the O
complexities O
and O
horrors O
involved O
in O
the O
trial O
for O
Tom O
Robinson O
's O
life O
. O

Harper O
Lee O
has O
remained O
famously O
detached O
from O
interpreting O
the O
novel O
since O
the O
mid O
1960s O
. O

However O
, O
she O
gave O
some O
insight O
into O
her O
themes O
when O
, O
in O
a O
rare O
letter O
to O
the O
editor O
, O
she O
wrote O
in O
response O
to O
the O
passionate O
reaction O
her O
book O
caused O
: O
`` O
Surely O
it O
is O
plain O
to O
the O
simplest O
intelligence O
that O
To O
Kill O
a O
Mockingbird O
spells O
out O
in O
words O
of O
seldom O
more O
than O
two O
syllables O
a O
code O
of O
honor O
and O
conduct O
, O
Christian O
in O
its O
ethic O
, O
that O
is O
the O
heritage O
of O
all B-KP
Southerners I-KP
. O
'' O

When O
the O
book O
was O
released O
, O
reviewers O
noted O
that O
it O
was O
divided O
into O
two O
parts O
, O
and O
opinion O
was O
mixed O
about O
Lee O
's O
ability O
to O
connect O
them O
. O

The O
first O
part O
of O
the O
novel O
concerns O
the O
children O
's O
fascination O
with O
Boo O
Radley O
and O
their O
feelings O
of O
safety O
and O
comfort O
in O
the B-KP
neighborhood I-KP
. O

Reviewers O
were O
generally O
charmed O
by O
Scout O
and O
Jem O
's O
observations O
of O
their O
quirky O
neighbors O
. O

One O
writer O
was O
so O
impressed O
by O
Lee O
's O
detailed O
explanations O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Maycomb O
that O
he O
categorized O
the O
book O
as O
Southern B-KP
romantic I-KP
regionalism I-KP
. O

This O
sentimentalism O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
Lee O
's O
representation O
of O
the O
Southern O
caste O
system O
to O
explain O
almost O
every O
character O
's O
behavior O
in O
the O
novel O
. O

Scout O
's O
Aunt O
Alexandra O
attributes O
Maycomb O
's O
inhabitants O
' O
faults O
and O
advantages O
to O
genealogy O
( O
families O
that O
have O
gambling O
streaks O
and O
drinking O
streaks O
) O
, O
and O
the O
narrator O
sets O
the O
action O
and O
characters O
amid O
a O
finely O
detailed O
background O
of O
the O
Finch O
family O
history O
and O
the O
history O
of O
Maycomb O
. O

This O
regionalist O
theme O
is O
further O
reflected O
in O
Mayella O
Ewell O
's O
apparent O
powerlessness O
to O
admit O
her O
advances O
toward O
Tom O
Robinson O
, O
and O
Scout O
's O
definition O
of O
`` O
fine B-KP
folks I-KP
'' O
being O
people O
with O
good O
sense O
who O
do O
the O
best O
they O
can O
with O
what O
they O
have O
. O

The B-KP
South I-KP
itself I-KP
, O
with O
its O
traditions O
and O
taboos O
, O
seems O
to O
drive O
the O
plot O
more O
than O
the O
characters O
. O

Tom B-KP
Robinson I-KP
is O
the O
chief O
example O
among O
several O
innocents O
destroyed O
carelessly O
or O
deliberately O
throughout O
the O
novel O
. O

However O
, O
scholar O
Christopher O
Metress O
connects O
the O
mockingbird O
to O
Boo B-KP
Radley I-KP
: O
`` O
Instead O
of O
wanting O
to O
exploit O
Boo O
for O
her O
own O
fun O
( O
as O
she O
does O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
novel O
by O
putting O
on O
gothic O
plays O
about O
his O
history O
) O
, O
Scout O
comes O
to O
see O
him O
as O
a O
'mockingbird O
' O
that O
is O
, O
as O
someone O
with O
an O
inner O
goodness O
that O
must O
be O
cherished O
. O
'' O

The O
last O
pages O
of O
the O
book O
illustrate O
this O
as O
Scout O
relates O
the O
moral O
of O
a O
story O
Atticus O
has O
been O
reading O
to O
her O
, O
and O
in O
allusions O
to O
both O
Boo O
Radley O
and O
Tom O
Robinson O
states O
about O
a O
character O
who O
was O
misunderstood O
, O
`` O
when O
they O
finally O
saw O
him O
, O
why O
he O
had O

done O
any O
of O
those O
things O

was O
real B-KP

to O
which O
he O

`` O

The O
novel O
exposes O
the O
loss O
of O
innocence O
so O
frequently O
that O
reviewer O
R. O
A. O
Dave O
claims O
that O
because O
every O
character O
has O
to O
face O
, O
or O
even O
suffer O
defeat O
, O
the O
book O
takes O
on O
elements O
of O
a O
classical B-KP
tragedy I-KP
. O

In O
exploring O
how O
each O
character O
deals O
with O
his O
or O
her O
own O
personal O
defeat O
, O
Lee O
builds O
a O
framework O
to O
judge O
whether O
the O
characters O
are O
heroes O
or O
fools O
. O

She O
guides O
the O
reader O
in O
such O
judgments O
, O
alternating O
between O
unabashed O
adoration O
and O
biting O
irony O
. O

Scout O
's O
experience O
with O
the O
Missionary O
Society O
is O
an O
ironic O
juxtaposition O
of O
women O
who O
mock O
her O
, O
gossip O
, O
and O
`` O
reflect O
a O
smug O
, O
colonialist O
attitude O
toward O

races O
'' O
while O
giving O
the O
`` O
appearance O
of O
gentility O
, O
piety O
, O
and O
morality O
'' O
. O

Conversely O
, O
when O
Atticus O
loses O
Tom O

case O
, O
he O
is O
last O
to O
leave O
the O
courtroom O

for O
his O
children O

the O
black O
spectators O

balcony O

who O
rise O
silently O
as O
he O
walks O
underneath O
them O

honor O

efforts O

Initial O
reactions O
to O
the O
novel O
were O
varied O

The O
New O

declared O
it O
`` O
skilled O
, O
unpretentious O

totally O

The O
Atlantic O
Monthly O

rated O
it O

praises O

`` O

writes O
that O
the O

that O

Defending O
the O

Akin B-KP
Ajayi I-KP
writes O
that O
justice O
`` O

the O
notion O
of O

'' O

Ajayi O
states O
that O
the O
book O
forces O
readers O
to O
question O
issues O
about O
race O

, O
but O
that O

the O

thematic O

racial O

its O
black O

not O

to O

simply O

, O
the O
book O
is O
viewed O
as O
marginalizing O
black O

One O
writer O
asserts O
that O
the O
use O
of O

serves O
as O
a O
convenient O
mechanism O
for O

to O
be O
innocent O

from O

Scout O

`` O

A O

that O

it O
`` O

Another O
criticism O
, O
articulated O
by O

is O
that O

states O

The O
International O
Organization O

has O
established O
a O
number O
of O
standards O

It O
is O
an O
important O

are O
broadly O

on O
the O
way O
they O
capture O

When O

Darwin O
he O
became O
an O

convert O
to O
Transformisme B-KP

as O
the O
French O
called O

His O
definition O
now O
became O

Broca O
, O
being O
what O
today O
would O
be O
called O
a O
neurosurgeon B-KP
, O
had O
taken O
an O
interest O
in O
the B-KP
pathology I-KP
of I-KP
speech I-KP
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
localize O
the O
difference O
between O
man O
and O
the O

animals O
, O
which O
appeared O
to O
reside O
in O

the O
human O

today O
called O
Broca O

after O
him O

His O
interest O
was O
mainly O
in O
Biological O
anthropology O
, O
but O
a O
German O
philosopher O
specializing O
in O
psychology B-KP
, O
Theodor O
Waitz O
, O
took O
up O
the O
theme O
of O
general O
and O
social O
anthropology O
in O
his O
six B-KP
volume O
work O
, O
entitled O
Die O
Anthropologie O
der O

, O
1859 O
1864 O
. O

The O
title O
was O
soon O
translated O
as O
`` O
The O
Anthropology O
of O
Primitive O
Peoples O
'' O
. O

The O
last O
two O
volumes O
were O
published O
posthumously O
. O

Waitz O
defined O
anthropology O
as O
`` O
the B-KP
science I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
nature I-KP
of I-KP
man I-KP
'' O
. O

By O
nature O
he O
meant O
matter O
animated O
by O
`` O
the O
Divine O

'' O
; O
i.e. O
, O
he O
was O
an B-KP
animist I-KP
. O

Following O
Broca O
's O
lead O
, O
Waitz O
points O
out O
that O
anthropology O
is O
a O
new O
field O
, O
which O
would O
gather O
material O
from O
other O
fields O
, O
but O
would O
differ O
from O
them O
in O
the O
use O
of O
comparative B-KP
anatomy I-KP
, I-KP
physiology I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
psychology I-KP
to O
differentiate O
man O
from O
`` O
the O
animals O
nearest O
to O
him O
'' O
. O

He O
stresses O
that O
the O
data O
of O
comparison O
must O
be O
empirical B-KP
, O
gathered O
by O
experimentation O
. O

The O
history O
of O
civilization B-KP
as O
well O
as O
ethnology O
are O
to O
be O
brought O
into O
the O
comparison O
. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
presumed O
fundamentally O
that O
the O
species O
, O
man O
, O
is O
a O
unity O
, O
and O
that O
`` O
the O
same O
laws O
of O
thought O
are O
applicable O
to O
all O
men O
'' O
. O

Waitz O
was O
influential O
among O
the O
British B-KP
ethnologists I-KP
. O

In O
1863 B-KP
the O
explorer O
Richard O
Francis O
Burton O
and O

broke O
away O

which O

would O
follow O
the O
path O
of O
the O

rather O

Its O
origins O

begin O
with O
the O
Polish O
British O

of O
Anthropology O

Bronislaw B-KP
Malinowski I-KP

and O
his O
French O

Economic O
Anthropologists O
have O
abandoned O
the O

were O
relegated O

Three O
main O
areas O
of O
interest O
rapidly O
developed O
. O

The O
first O
of O
these O
areas O
was O
concerned O
with O
the O
`` O
pre O

societies O
that O
were O
subject O
to O
evolutionary O
`` O

as O
the O
'original O

society O
' O
did O
much O
to O
dissipate O
that O
image O
. O

The O
second O
area O
was O
concerned O
with O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
the O
world O
's O
population B-KP
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
peasantry O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
were O
involved O
in O
complex O
revolutionary O
wars O
such O
as O
in O
Vietnam O
. O

The O
third O
area O
was O
on O
colonialism O
, O
imperialism O
, O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
capitalist O
world O
system O
. O

More O
recently O

these O
Political O

it O

Anthropology O
of O
development O
tends O
to O
view O

from O
a O
critical B-KP
perspective O

The O
kind O
of O
issues O
addressed O
and O
implications O
for O
the O
approach O
simply O
involve O
pondering B-KP
why O
, O
if O
a O
key O
development O
goal O
is O
to O
alleviate O
poverty O
, O
is O
poverty O
increasing B-KP
? O

Why O
is O
there O
such O
a O
gap B-KP
between O
plans O
and O
outcomes O
? O

Why O
are O
those O
working O
in O
development O
so O
willing O
to O
disregard O
history O
and O
the O
lessons O
it O
might O
offer O
? O

Why O
is O
development O
so O
externally O
driven O
rather O
than O
having O
an O
internal O
basis O
? O

In O
short O
why O
does O
so O
much O
planned O
development O
fail B-KP
? O

Kinship B-KP
can O
refer O
both O
to O
the O
study O

Political O
anthropology O
developed O
as O
a O
discipline O
concerned O
primarily O
with O
politics O
in O
stateless O
societies O
, O
a O
new O
development O
started O
from O
the B-KP
1960s I-KP
, O
and O
is O
still O
unfolding O
: O
anthropologists O
started O
increasingly O
to O
study O
more O
`` O

social O
settings O

the O
presence O

both O

The O
turn O
towards O
complex O
societies O
meant O
that O
political O
themes O
were O
taken O
up O
at O
two O
main O
levels O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O

continued O
to O
study O
political O
organization O

political O
phenomena O
that O

. O

Second O
of O
all O
, O

slowly O
started O

There O
has O
also O
been O
a O

shift O
toward O
broadening O
the O

beyond O
the O

life I-KP
of I-KP
ordinary I-KP

increasingly O
, O
research B-KP

Following O
the O
earthquake O
, O
Joseph O
I O
gave O
his O
Prime O
Minister O
even O
more O
power O
, O
and O
Sebasti O
o O
de O

became O
a O
powerful O
, O
progressive O
dictator O
. O

As O
his O
power O
grew O
, O
his O
enemies O
increased O
in O
number O
, O
and O
bitter O
disputes O
with O
the O
high O

became O
frequent O
. O

In O
1758 O
Joseph O

was O
wounded B-KP
in I-KP
an I-KP

The B-KP

the I-KP

were O
implicated O

The B-KP

Sebasti B-KP

prosecuted I-KP
every I-KP

even I-KP

This O
was O
the O
final O
stroke O
that O
broke O
the O
power O
of O
the O

Joseph O
I O
made O
his O
loyal O

Count O

Following O

Joseph I-KP

death I-KP
in I-KP
1779 I-KP

However O
, O
historians O
also O
argue O
that O
Pombal O
s O
`` O
enlightenment O
, O
'' O
while O
far O
reaching O
, O
was O
primarily O
a O
mechanism O
for O
enhancing O
autocracy B-KP
at O
the O
expense O
of O
individual O
liberty O
and O
especially O
an O
apparatus O
for O

suppressing I-KP

With O
the O

Portugal O
began O
a O
slow O
but O
inexorable O
decline O
that O
lasted O
until B-KP
the I-KP
20th I-KP

This O
decline O
was O
hastened O
by O
the O

1822 B-KP
of O

In O

During O

among O

the O
County O

At O
times O
the O
Kingdom O

existed O

for O
short O
periods O

usually O
formed O
an O
important O

Throughout O
this O
period O
, O
the O
people O
of O
County O
of O
Portugal O
as O
Galicians O
found O
themselves O
struggling O
to O
maintain B-KP
the I-KP

Galicia I-KP
with I-KP
its I-KP
distinct I-KP

whenever O
the O

changed O

As O
a O
result O
of O
political O
division O
, O
Galician O
Portuguese O
lost O
its O
unity O
when O
the O

( O
a O

The O
Galician B-KP
and O
Portuguese O
versions O
of O
the O

then O
diverged O
over O
time O

they O
followed O
independent O

paths O

This O
began O
occurring O
when O
the O
Kingdom O

the O
Kingdom O

Castile O
united O
and O
the O
Castilian O
Language O
( O
known O
as O
Spanish B-KP

slowly O
over O
the O
centuries O
began O
influencing O
the O
Galician O
Language O
and O
then O
trying O
to O
replace O
it O
. O

The O
same O
thing O
happened O
to O
Astur O
Leonese O

to O
the O
point O
where O
it O

Portugal O
lost O

and O
though O
few O
in O

they O
constituted O
the O

the O

The O
Muslims O
were O
expelled O

300 O

Alfonso O

in O

Fruela O
became O
king O

His O
death O
the O
next O
year O
initiated O
a O
series O
of O
internecine O
struggles O
that O
led O
to O
unstable O
succession O
for O
over O
a O
century O

It O
continued O
under O
that O
name O
[ O

until O
incorporated O

1230 B-KP
, O
after O
Ferdinand O

became O
joint O
king O
of O
the O
two O

This O
was O
done O
to O
avoid O
dynastic O
feuds O
and O
to O
maintain O
the O
Christian O

strong O
enough O
to O
prevent O

In O
1373 O
, O
Portugal B-KP
made I-KP
an I-KP
alliance I-KP
with I-KP
England I-KP

which O
is O
the O
longest O

in O
the O

This O

is O
regarded O
by O
many O
as O
the O
predecessor O
to O

Over O

this O
went O

this O
was O

He O
ruled O

along O

The O
Statistics O
Portugal O
( O
Portuguese O

estimates O
that O
, O
according O
to O
the O
2011 O
census O
, O
the O
population O
was O
10,562,178 B-KP
( O
of O
which O
52 B-KP
% I-KP
was O
female O
, O
48 B-KP

was O
male O
) O
. O

This O
population O
has O
been O
relatively O
homogeneous O
for O
most O
of O
its O
history O
: O
a O
single O
religion O
( O
Catholicism B-KP
) O
and O
a O
single O
language O
have O
contributed O
to O
this O
ethnic O
and O
national O
unity O
, O
namely O
after O
the O
expulsion O
of O
the O
Moors O
and O
Jews O
. O

A O
considerable O
number O
of O
Moors O

Jews O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
stayed O
in O
Portugal O
, O
under O
the O
condition O
that O
they O
converted O
to O
Catholicism O
, O
and O
afterwards O
they O
were O
known O
as O
Mouriscos B-KP
( O
former O
Muslims O
) O
and O
Crist O
os O
Novos O
( O
New O
Christians O

some O
of O
whom O
may O
have O
continued O
to O
observe O
rabbinic O
Judaism O
in O
secret O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
secret O
Jews O
of O
Belmonte O
, O
who O
now O
observe O
the O
Jewish O
faith O
openly O
. O

After O
1772 O
the O
distinction O
between O
Old O

New O
Christians O
was O
abolished O
by O

Some O

were O
the O

The O
most O
important O
demographic O
influence O
in O
the O
modern O
Portuguese O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
oldest O
one O
; O
current O
interpretation O
of O
Y O
chromosome O
and O
mtDNA O
data O
suggests O
that O
the O
Portuguese O
have O
their O
origin O
in O
Paleolithic B-KP
peoples I-KP
that O
began O
arriving O
to O
the O
European O
continent O
around O
45,000 B-KP
years I-KP
ago I-KP
. O

All O
subsequent O
migrations O
did O
leave O
an O
impact O
, O
genetically O
and O
culturally O
, O
but O
the O
main O
population O
source O
of O
the O
Portuguese O
is O
still O
Paleolithic B-KP
. O

Genetic O
studies O
show O
Portuguese O
populations O
not O
to O
be O
significantly O
different O
from O
other O
European O
populations O
. O

Portugal O
's O
colonial B-KP
history I-KP
has O
long O
since O
been O
a O
cornerstone O
of O
its O
national O
identity O
, O
as O
has O
its O
geographic O
position O
at O
the O
south O
western O
corner O
of O
Europe O
, O
looking O
out O
into O
the O
Atlantic B-KP
Ocean I-KP
. O

It O
was O
one O
of O
the O
last O
western O
colonial O
European O
powers O
to O
give O
up O
its O
overseas O
territories O
( O
among O
them O
Angola B-KP

Mozambique I-KP

Macau O
to O
the O
People O

of O
China O
at O
the O

Consequently O
, O
it O
has O
both O
influenced O
and O
been O
influenced O
by O
cultures O
from O
former O

or O
dependencies O
, O
resulting O
in O

demonstrated O
an O
affinity O
for O

at O

early O
age O
; O

began O
writing B-KP
poetry I-KP
when O

music O
when O
he O
was O
in O
the O
third O
grade O
. O

Growing O
up O
in O
the O
city O

[ O
which O
? O
] O

West O
became O
deeply O
involved O
in O
its O
hip O
hop O
scene O
. O

He O
started O
rapping O
in O
the O
third O
grade O
and O
began O
making O
musical O
compositions O
in O
the O
seventh O
grade O
, O
eventually O
selling O
them O
to O
other O
artists O
. O

At O
age O
thirteen O
, O
West O
wrote O
a O
rap O
song O
called O
`` O
Green B-KP
Eggs I-KP
and I-KP
Ham I-KP
'' O
and O
began O
to O
persuade O
his O
mother O
to O
pay O
$ O
25 O
an O
hour O
for O
time O
in O
a O
recording O
studio O
. O

It O
was O
a O
small O
, O
crude O
basement O
studio O
where O
a O
microphone O
hung O
from O
the O
ceiling O
by O
a O
wire O

Although O
this O
was O
n't O
what O
West O

mother O
wanted O
, O
she O
nonetheless O
supported O
him O
. O

West O
crossed O
paths O
with O
producer/DJ O
No B-KP
I.D. I-KP
, I-KP
with O
whom O
he O
quickly O
formed O
a O
close O
friendship O
. O

No O
I.D O
. O

soon O
became O
West O

mentor O
, O
and O
it O
was O
from O
him O
that O
West O
learned O
how O
to O
sample O
and O
program O
beats O
after O
he O
received O
his O
first O

at O
age O
15 O

After O
graduating O
from O

received O
a O

to O

in O
1997 O

began O

classes O
, O
but O
shortly O
after O
transferred O
to O
Chicago O
State O
University O
to O
study O
English B-KP

He O
soon O
realized O
that O
his O
busy O
class O
schedule O
was O
detrimental O
to O
his O
musical O
work O
, O
and O
at O
20 B-KP
he O
dropped O
out O
of O

to O
pursue O
his O
musical O
dreams O

This O
action O
greatly O
displeased O
his O
mother O
, O
who O
was O
also O
a O
professor O
at O
the O
university O
. O

She O
later O
commented O
, O
`` O

was O
drummed O
into O
my O
head O
that O

the O
ticket O
to O
a O

but O
some O
career O

do O
n't O
require O
college O

For O
Kanye O
to O
make O
an O

called O

it O
was O
more O
about O

the O

when O

West O
came O
to O

often O
credited O
with O
revitalizing O
Jay O

The B-KP

The O
Blueprint O

consistently O
ranked O
among O
the O
greatest O
hip O

albums O
, O
and O
the O
critical O
and O
financial O
success O
of O
the O
album O
generated O
substantial O
interest O
in O
West O
as O
a O
producer O
. O

Serving O
as O
an O
in O
house O
producer O
for O
Roc O
A O
Fella O
Records O
, O
West O
produced O
records O
for O
other O
artists O
from O
the O
label O
, O
including O
Beanie O

He O
also O
crafted O
hit O
songs O
for O
Ludacris O
, O
Alicia O
Keys O
, O
and O
Janet O
Jackson O
. O

Despite O
his O
success O
as O
a O
producer O
, O
West O
's O
true O
aspiration O
was O
to O
be O
a O
rapper B-KP
. O

Though O
he O
had O
developed O
his O
rapping O
long O
before O
he O
began O
producing O
, O
it O
was O
often O
a O
challenge O
for O
West O
to O
be O
accepted O
as O
a O
rapper O
, O
and O
he O
struggled O
to O
attain O
a O
record O
deal O
. O

Multiple O
record O
companies O
ignored O
him O
because O
he O
did O
not O
portray O
the O
gangsta B-KP
image I-KP
prominent O
in O
mainstream O
hip O
hop O
at O
the O
time O
. O

After O
a O
series O
of O
meetings O
with O
Capitol B-KP
Records I-KP
, O
West O
was O
ultimately O
denied O
an O
artist O
deal O
. O

According O
to O
Capitol O
Record O
's O
A O
& O
R O
, O
Joe B-KP
Weinberger I-KP
, O
he O
was O
approached O
by O
West O
and O
almost O
signed O
a O
deal O
with O
him O
, O
but O
another O
person O
in O
the O
company O
convinced O
Capitol O
's O
president O
not O
to O
. O

Desperate O
to O
keep O
West O
from O
defecting O
to O
another O
label O
, O
then O
label O
head O
Damon O
Dash O
reluctantly O
signed O
West O
to O
Roc B-KP
A I-KP
Fella I-KP
Records O
. O

Jay O
Z O
later O
admitted O
that O
Roc O
A O
Fella O
was O
initially O
reluctant O
to O
support O
West O
as O
a O
rapper O
, O
claiming O
that O
many O
saw O
him O
as O
a B-KP
producer I-KP
first O
and O
foremost O
, O
and O
that O
his O
background O
contrasted O
with O
that O
of O
his O
labelmates O
. O

West O
's O
breakthrough O
came O
a O
year O
later O
on O
October B-KP
23 I-KP
, I-KP
2002 I-KP
, O
when O
, O
while O
driving O
home O
from O
a O
California O
recording O
studio O
after O
working O
late O
, O
he O
fell O
asleep O
at O
the O
wheel O
and O
was O
involved O
in O
a O
near O
fatal O
car O
crash O
. O

The O
crash O
left O
him O
with O
a O
shattered O
jaw O
, O
which O
had O
to O
be O
wired O
shut O
in O
reconstructive O
surgery O
. O

The O
accident O
inspired O
West O
; O
two O
weeks O
after O
being O
admitted O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
he O
recorded O
a O
song O
at O
the O
Record O
Plant O
Studios O
with O
his O
jaw O
still O
wired O
shut O
. O

The O
composition O
, O
`` O
Through B-KP
The I-KP
Wire I-KP
'' O
, O
expressed O
West O
's O
experience O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
and O
helped O
lay O
the O
foundation O
for O
his O
debut O
album O
, O
as O
according O
to O
West O
`` O
all O
the O
better O
artists O
have O
expressed O
what O
they O
were O
going O
through O
'' O
. O

West O
added O
that O
`` O
the O
album O
was O
my O
medicine O
'' O
, O
as O
working O
on O
the O
record O
distracted O
him O
from O
the O
pain O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
West O
announced O
that O
he O
was O
working O
on O
an O
album O
called O
The B-KP
College I-KP
Dropout I-KP
, O
whose O
overall O
theme O
was O
to O
`` O
make O
your O
own O
decisions O

Do O
n't O
let O
society O
tell O
you O
, O

Carrying O
a O
Louis O
Vuitton O
backpack O
filled O
with O
old O
disks O
and O
demos O
to O
the O
studio O
and O
back O
, O
West O
crafted O
much O
of O
his O
production O
for O
his O
debut O
album O
in O
less O
than O
fifteen O
minutes O
at O
a O
time O
. O

He O
recorded O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
album O
in O
Los B-KP
Angeles I-KP
while O
recovering O
from O
the O
car O
accident O
. O

Once O
he O
had O
completed O
the O
album O
, O
it B-KP
was I-KP
leaked I-KP
months O
before O
its O
release O
date O
. O

However O
, O
West O
decided O
to O
use O
the O
opportunity O
to O
review O
the O
album O
, O
and O
The O
College O
Dropout O
was O
significantly O
remixed O
, O
remastered O
, O
and O
revised O
before O
being O
released O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
certain O
tracks O
originally O
destined O
for O
the O
album O
were O
subsequently O
retracted O
, O
among O
them O
`` O

with O
Consequence O

West O
meticulously O
refined O
the O
production O
, O
adding O
string O
arrangements O
, O
gospel O
choirs O
, O
improved O
drum O
programming O
and O
new O
verses O
. O

West O
's O
perfectionism O
led O
The O
College O
Dropout O
to O
have O
its O
release O
postponed O
three O
times O
from O
its O
initial O
date O
in O
August B-KP
2003 I-KP
. O

The O
College O

was O
eventually O
issued O
by O
Roc O
A O
Fella O
in O
February B-KP
2004 I-KP
, O
shooting O
to O
number O
two O
on O
the O
Billboard O

as O
his O
debut O
single O
, O
`` O

'' O
peaked O
at O
number O
fifteen O
on O
the O
Billboard O
Hot O

for O
five O
weeks O
. O

`` O
Slow O

'' O
, O
his O
second O
single O
featuring O
Twista O
and O
Jamie O
Foxx O
, O
became O
an O
even O
bigger O
success O
: O
it O
became O
the O
three O
musicians O
' O
first O
number O
one O
hit O
. O

The O
College O
Dropout O
received O
near O
universal O
critical O
acclaim O
from O
contemporary O
music O
critics O
, O
was O
voted O
the O
top O
album O
of O
the O
year O
by O
two O
major O
music O
publications O
, O
and O
has O
consistently O
been O
ranked O
among O
the O
great O
hip O
hop O
works O
and O
debut O
albums O
by O
artists O
. O

`` O
Jesus B-KP
Walks I-KP
'' O
, O
the O
album O
's O
fourth O
single O
, O
perhaps O
exposed O
West O
to O
a O
wider O
audience O
; O
the O
song O
's O
subject O
matter O
concerns O
faith O
and O
Christianity O
. O

The O
song O
nevertheless O
reached O
the O
top O
20 O
of O
the O
Billboard O
pop O
charts O
, O
despite O
industry O
executives O
' O
predictions O
that O
a O
song O
containing O
such O
blatant O
declarations O
of O
faith O
would O
never O
make O
it O
to O
radio O
. O

The O
College O
Dropout O
would O
eventually O
be O
certified O
triple O
platinum O
in O
the O
US O
, O
and O
garnered O
West O
10 O
Grammy O
nominations O
, O
including O
Album O
of O
the O
Year O
, O
and O
Best O
Rap O
Album O
( O
which O
it O
received O
) O
. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
West O
also O
founded O
GOOD B-KP
Music I-KP
, O
a O
record O
label O
and O
management O
company O
that O
would O
go O
on O
to O
house O
affiliate O
artists O
and O
producers O
, O
such O
as O
No O
I.D O
. O

and O
John O
Legend O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
the O
focal O
point O
of O
West O
's O
production O
style O
was O
the O
use O
of O
sped O
up O
vocal O
samples O
from O
soul O
records O
. O

However O
, O
partly O
because O
of O
the O
acclaim O
of O
The O
College O
Dropout O
, O
such O
sampling O
had O
been O
much O
copied O
by O
others O
; O
with O
that O
overuse O
, O
and O
also O
because O
West O
felt O
he O
had O
become O
too O
dependent O
on O
the O
technique O
, O
he O
decided O
to O
find O
a O
new O
sound O
. O

Beginning O
his O
second O
effort O
that O
fall O
, O
West O
would O
invest O
two O
million O
dollars O
and O
take O
over O
a O
year O
to O
craft O
his O
second O
album O
. O

West O
was O
significantly O
inspired O
by O
Roseland O
NYC O
Live O
, O
a O
1998 O
live O
album O
by O
English O
trip O
hop O
group O
Portishead B-KP
, O
produced O
with O
the O
New O
York O
Philharmonic O
Orchestra O
. O

Early O
in O
his O
career O
, O
the O
live O
album O
had O
inspired O
him O
to O
incorporate O
string O
arrangements O
into O
his O
hip O
hop O
production O
. O

Though O
West O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
afford O
many O
live O
instruments O
around O
the O
time O
of O
his O
debut O
album O
, O
the O
money O
from O
his O
commercial O
success O
enabled O
him O
to O
hire O
a O
string B-KP
orchestra I-KP
for O
his O
second O
album O
Late B-KP
Registration I-KP
. O

West O
collaborated O
with O
American O
film O
score O
composer O
Jon B-KP
Brion I-KP
, O
who O
served O
as O
the O
album O
's O
co O
executive O
producer O
for O
several O
tracks O
. O

Although O
Brion O
had O
no O
prior O
experience O
in O
creating O
hip O
hop O
records O
, O
he O
and O
West O
found O
that O
they O
could O
productively O
work O
together O
after O
their O
first O
afternoon O
in O
the O
studio O
where O
they O
discovered O
that O
neither O
confined O
his O
musical O
knowledge O
and O
vision O
to O
one O
specific O
genre O
. O

Late O
Registration O
sold O
over O
2.3 B-KP
million I-KP
units O
in O
the O
United O
States O
alone O
by O
the O
end O
of O
2005 O
and O
was O
considered O
by O
industry O
observers O
as O
the O
only O
successful O
major O
album O
release O
of O
the O
fall O
season O
, O
which O
had O
been O
plagued O
by O
steadily O
declining O
CD O
sales O
. O

While O
West O
had O
encountered O
controversy O
a O
year O
prior O
when O
he O
stormed O
out O
of O
the O
American O
Music O

of O
2004 O
after O
losing O

the O

following O
Late O

, O
during O
a O

In O
September O
2005 O

A B-KP

When O
West O
was O

he O
deviated O
from O

Once O

he O
said O
, O
`` O
George O

'' O

West O
's O
comment O
reached O
much O
of O
the O
United O

, O
leading O
to O
mixed O
reactions O
; O
President O
Bush O
would O
later O
call O
it O
one O
of O
the O
most O
`` O
disgusting O
moments O
'' O
of O
his O
presidency O
. O

West O
raised O
further O
controversy O
in O
January O
2006 O
when O
he O
posed O
on O
the O
cover O
of O
Rolling B-KP

wearing O
a O
crown O
of O
thorns O

Fresh O
off O
spending O
the O
previous O
year O
touring O
the O
world O
with O
U2 B-KP
on O
their O
Vertigo O
Tour O
, O
West O
felt O
inspired O
to O
compose O
anthemic O
rap O
songs O
that O
could O
operate O
more O
efficiently O
in O
large B-KP
arenas I-KP
. O

To O
this O
end O
, O
West O
incorporated O
the O
synthesizer O
into O
his O
hip O

production O
, O
utilized O
slower O
tempos O
, O
and O
experimented O
with O
electronic O
music O
and O
influenced O
by O
music O
of O
the O
1980s B-KP

In O
addition O
to O

West O
drew O

described O

West O
claiming O
`` O
the O

Critic O
Robert O

wrote O
that O
`` O
there O

never O
been O

so O
complex O

subtle O
musically O

'' O

For O
a O
period O
of O
time O
, O
Kanye O
West O
stood O
as O
the O
sole O
current O

star O
to O
tour O
with O
a B-KP

, O
as O
audible O

With O
his O
third O

, O
Graduation B-KP
( O
2007 B-KP

, O
West O
moved O
away O
from O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
previous O

towards O
a O
more B-KP
atmospheric I-KP

, O
American O

and O
his O
native O
Chicago O

Towards O
this O
end O
, O
West O
retracted O
much O
of O
the O
live O
instrumentation O
that O
characterized O
his O
previous O
album O

replaced O
it O
with O
heavy O

array O
of O

In O

, O
West O
drew O
musical O

West O

fourth O
studio O
album O
, O
808s O

Heartbreak O
( O
2008 O
) O
, O
marked O
an O
even O
more O
radical O
departure O
from O
his O
previous O
releases O
, O
largely O
abandoning O
rap O
and O
hip O

stylings O
in O
favor O
of O
a O

a O

the O

uddhodana O

determined O

king I-KP

so O
he O
prevented B-KP
him I-KP
from I-KP
leaving I-KP
the I-KP

But O
at O
age O
29 B-KP
, O
despite O
his O
father O

efforts O
, O
Gautama O
ventured O
beyond O
the O
palace O
several O
times O
. O

In O
a O
series O
of O
encounters O
known O
in O
Buddhist O
literature O
as O
the B-KP
four B-KP
sights I-KP
he B-KP
learned I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
suffering I-KP
of I-KP
ordinary I-KP
people I-KP
, O
encountering B-KP
an I-KP
old I-KP
man I-KP

a I-KP
sick I-KP
man I-KP

a I-KP
corpse B-KP

finally I-KP
, I-KP
an I-KP
ascetic I-KP
holy I-KP
man I-KP
, O
apparently O
content O
and O
at O
peace O
with O
the O
world O
. O

These O
experiences O
prompted O
Gautama O
to O
abandon B-KP
royal I-KP
life I-KP
and O
take O
up O
a O
spiritual O
quest O
. O

Gautama O
first O
went B-KP
to I-KP
study I-KP
with I-KP
famous I-KP
religious I-KP
teachers I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
day I-KP
, O
and O
mastered O
the O
meditative O
attainments O
they O
taught O
. O

But O
he O
found O
that O
they B-KP
did I-KP
not I-KP
provide I-KP
a I-KP
permanent I-KP
end I-KP
to I-KP
suffering I-KP
, O
so O
he O
continued O
his O
quest O
. O

He O
next O
attempted O
an O
extreme O
asceticism B-KP
, O
which O
was O
a O
religious O
pursuit O
common O
among O
the O
rama O
as O
, O
a O
religious O
culture O
distinct O
from O
the O
Vedic O
one O
. O

Gautama O
underwent O
prolonged B-KP
fasting I-KP
, I-KP
breath I-KP
holding I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
exposure I-KP
to I-KP
pain I-KP
. O

He O
almost O
starved O
himself O
to O
death O
in O
the O
process O
. O

He O
realized O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
this O
kind O
of O
practice O
to O
its O
limit O
, O
and O
had O
not O
put O
an O
end O
to O
suffering O
. O

So O
in O
a O
pivotal O
moment O
he O
accepted O
milk B-KP
and I-KP
rice I-KP
from O
a O
village O
girl O
and O
changed O
his O
approach O
. O

He O
devoted O
himself O
to O
anapanasati B-KP
meditation B-KP
, O
through O
which O
he O
discovered O
what O
Buddhists O
call O
the B-KP

now O

to O
complete O
his O
spiritual O
quest O

At O
the O
age O

35 B-KP

vowed O

After O
many O

he O

destroyed O
the O

liberating O
himself O

Everything B-KP

senses O

made O
up O

its O
existence O

Everything O

conditions O

the O

doctrine O
asserts O
that O
because B-KP
things I-KP

impermanent I-KP

attachment O

them O
is O
futile O

leads O
to O
suffering B-KP

also O
a O
central O

Mahayana O
Buddhism O
received O
significant O
theoretical O
grounding O
from O
Nagarjuna O
( O
perhaps O
c. O
150 O
250 O
CE O
) O
, O
arguably O
the O
most O
influential O
scholar O
within O
the O
Mahayana O
tradition O
. O

Nagarjuna O
's O
primary O
contribution O
to O
Buddhist O
philosophy O
was O
the O
systematic O
exposition O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
nyat O
, O
or O
`` O
emptiness B-KP
'' O
, O
widely O
attested O
in O
the O
Praj O
p O
ramit O
sutras O
that O
emerged O
in O
his O
era O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
emptiness O
brings O
together O
other O
key O
Buddhist O
doctrines O
, O
particularly O
anatta O
and O
dependent O
origination O
, O
to O
refute O
the O
metaphysics O
of O
Sarvastivada O
and O
Sautrantika O
( O
extinct O
non O
Mahayana O
schools O
) O
. O

For O
Nagarjuna O
, O
it O
is O
not O
merely O
sentient O
beings O
that O
are O
empty O
of O
tman O
; O
all O
phenomena B-KP
( O
dharmas O
) O
are O
without O
any O
svabhava O
( O
literally O
`` O
own O
nature O
'' O
or O
`` O
self O
nature O
'' O
) O
, O
and O
thus O
without O
any O
underlying O
essence O
; O
they O
are O
`` O
empty O
'' O
of O
being O
independent O
; O
thus O
the O
heterodox O
theories O
of O
svabhava O
circulating O
at O
the O
time O
were O
refuted O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
doctrines O
of O
early O
Buddhism O
. O

Nagarjuna O
's O
school O
of O
thought O
is O
known O
as O
the O
M O
dhyamaka O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
writings O
attributed O
to O
Nagarjuna O
made O
explicit O
references O
to O
Mahayana O
texts O
, O
but O
his O
philosophy O
was O
argued O
within O
the O
parameters O
set O
out O
by O
the O
agamas O
. O

He O
may O
have O
arrived O
at O
his O
positions O
from O
a O
desire O
to O
achieve O
a O
consistent O
exegesis O
of O
the O
Buddha O
's O
doctrine O
as O
recorded O
in O
the O
Canon O
. O

In O
the O
eyes O
of O
Nagarjuna O
the O
Buddha O
was O
not O
merely O
a O
forerunner O
, O
but O
the O
very O
founder O
of O
the O
M O
dhyamaka O
system O
. O

Sarvastivada B-KP
teachings I-KP
which O
were O
criticized O
by O
N O

were O
reformulated O
by O
scholars O
such O
as O
Vasubandhu B-KP
and I-KP
Asanga I-KP
and O
were O
adapted O
into O
the O
Yogacara O
school O
. O

While O
the O
M O
dhyamaka O
school O
held O
that O
asserting O
the O
existence O
or O
non O
existence O
of O
any O
ultimately O
real O
thing O
was O
inappropriate O
, O
some O
exponents O
of O

asserted O
that O
the O

only O
the O
mind O
is O
ultimately O
real O
( O
a O
doctrine O
known O
as O
cittamatra B-KP

Not O
all O

asserted O
that O

truly O
existent O

These O

the O

of O

Besides O

to O
these O

Nirvana B-KP
( O
Sanskrit O
; O
Pali O
: O
`` O
Nibb O

'' O
) O
means O
`` O
cessation O
'' O
, O
`` O
extinction O
'' O
( O
of O
craving O
and O
ignorance O
and O
therefore O
suffering O

`` O

, O
`` O

`` O

; O
it O
is O
also O
known O
as O
`` O
Awakening O
'' O
or O
`` O
Enlightenment O
'' O
in O
the O
West O
. O

The O
term O
for O
anybody O
who O
has O
achieved O
nirvana B-KP
, O
including O
the O
Buddha O
, O
is O
arahant B-KP
. O

Bodhi B-KP
( O
P O
li O
and O
Sanskrit O
, O
in O
devanagari O
: O
) O
is O
a O
term O
applied O
to O
the O
experience O
of O
Awakening O
of O
arahants O
. O

Bodhi O
literally O
means O
`` O
awakening O
'' O
, O
but O
it O
is O
more O
commonly O
translated O
into O
English O
as O
`` O
enlightenment O
'' O
. O

In O
Early O
Buddhism O
, O
bodhi O
carried O
a O
meaning O
synonymous O
to O
nirvana B-KP
, O
using O
only O
some O
different O
metaphors O
to O
describe O
the O
experience O
, O
which O
implies O
the O
extinction O
of O
raga B-KP
( O
greed O
, O
craving O
) O
, O
[ O

dosa B-KP
( O
hate O
, O
aversion O
) O
[ O

13 O
] O
and O
moha O
( O
delusion B-KP
) O
. O

[ O

] O
In O
the O
later O
school O
of O
Mahayana O
Buddhism O
, O
the O
status O
of O
nirvana O
was O
downgraded O
in O
some O
scriptures O
, O
coming O
to O
refer O
only O
to O
the O
extinction O
of O
greed O
and O
hate O
, O
implying O
that O
delusion O
was O
still O
present O
in O
one O
who O
attained O
nirvana O
, O
and O
that O
one O
needed O
to O
attain O
bodhi O
to O
eradicate O
delusion O
: O

Therefore O
, O
according O
to O
Mahayana O
Buddhism O
, O
the O
arahant O
has O
attained O
only O
nirvana B-KP
, O
thus O
still O
being O
subject O
to O
delusion O
, O
while O
the O
bodhisattva B-KP
not O
only O
achieves O
nirvana O
but O
full O
liberation O
from O
delusion O
as O
well O
. O

He O
thus O
attains O
bodhi O
and O
becomes O
a B-KP
buddha I-KP
. O

In O
Theravada O
Buddhism O
, O
bodhi O
and O
nirvana O
carry O
the O
same O
meaning O
as O
in O
the O
early O
texts O
, O
that O
of O
being O
freed O
from O
greed O
, O
hate O
and O
delusion O
. O

The O
term O
parinirvana B-KP
is O
also O
encountered O
in O
Buddhism O
, O
and O
this O
generally O
refers O
to O
the O
complete O
nirvana O
attained O
by O
the O
arahant O
at O
the O
moment O
of O
death O
, O
when O
the O
physical O
body O
expires O
. O

According O
to O
Buddhist O
traditions O
a B-KP
Buddha I-KP
is O
a O
fully O
awakened O
being O
who O
has O
completely O
purified O
his O
mind O
of O
the O
three O
poisons O
of O
desire O
, O
aversion O
and O
ignorance O
. O

A O
Buddha O
is O
no O
longer O
bound O
by O
Samsara B-KP
and O
has O
ended O
the O
suffering B-KP
which O
unawakened O
people O
experience O
in O
life O
. O

Buddhists O
do O
not O
consider O
Siddhartha O
Gautama O
to O
have O
been O
the O
only O
Buddha O
. O

The O
Pali O
Canon O
refers O
to O
many O
previous O
ones O
( O
see O
List O
of O
the O
28 B-KP
Buddhas O
) O
, O
while O
the O
Mahayana O
tradition O
additionally O
has O
many O
Buddhas O
of O
celestial B-KP
, O
rather O
than O
historical O
, O
origin O
( O

. O

A O
common O
Theravada O
and O
Mahayana O
Buddhist O
belief O
is O
that O
the O
next O
Buddha O
will O
be O
one O
named O
Maitreya B-KP
( O
Pali O
: O
Metteyya O
) O
. O

In O
Theravada O
doctrine O
, O
a O
person O
may O
awaken O
from O
the O
`` O
sleep O
of O
ignorance O
'' O
by O
directly O
realizing O
the O
true O
nature O
of O
reality B-KP
; O
such O
people O
are O
called O
arahants B-KP
and O
occasionally O
buddhas O
. O

After O
numerous O
lifetimes O
of O
spiritual O
striving O
, O
they O
have O
reached O
the O
end O
of O
the O
cycle O
of O
rebirth O
, O
no O
longer O
reincarnating O
as O
human O
, O
animal O
, O
ghost O
, O
or O
other O
being O
. O

The O
commentaries O
to O
the O
Pali O
Canon O
classify O
these O
awakened O
beings O
into O
three O
types O
: O

Bodhi B-KP
and O
nirvana O
carry O
the O
same O
meaning O
, O
that O
of O
being O
freed O
from O
craving O
, O
hate O
, O
and O
delusion O
. O

In O
attaining O
bodhi O
, O
the O
arahant O
has O
overcome O
these O
obstacles O
. O

As O
a O
further O
distinction O
, O
the O
extinction O
of O
only O
hatred O
and O
greed O
( O
in O
the O
sensory O
context O
) O
with O
some O
residue O
of O
delusion O
, O
is O
called O
anagami B-KP
. O

In O
the O
Mahayana B-KP
, O
the O
Buddha B-KP
tends O
not O
to O
be O
viewed O
as O
merely O
human O
, O
but O
as O
the O
earthly O
projection O
of O
a O
beginningless O
and O
endless O
, O
omnipresent O
being O
( O
see O
Dharmakaya O
) O
beyond O
the O
range O
and O
reach O
of O
thought O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
certain O
Mahayana O
sutras O
, O
the O
Buddha O
, O
Dharma O
and O
Sangha O
are O
viewed O
essentially O
as O
One O
: O
all O
three O
are O
seen O
as O
the O
eternal O
Buddha O
himself O
. O

The O
Buddha O
's O
death O
is O
seen O
as O
an O
illusion O
, O
he O
is O
living O
on O
in O
other O
planes O
of O
existence B-KP
, O
and O
monks B-KP
are O
therefore O
permitted O
to O
offer O
`` O
new O
truths O
'' O
based O
on O
his O
input O
. O

Mahayana O
also O
differs O
from O
Theravada O
in O
its O
concept O
of O
nyat O
( O
that O
ultimately O
nothing O
has O
existence O
) O
, O
and O
in O
its O
belief O
in O
bodhisattvas B-KP
( O
enlightened O
people O
who O
vow O
to O
continue O
being O
reborn O
until O
all O
beings O
can O
be O
enlightened O
) O
. O

The O
method O
of O
self O
exertion O
or O
`` O
self O
power O
'' O
without O
reliance O
on O
an O
external O
force O
or O
being O
stands O
in O
contrast O
to O
another O
major O
form O
of O
Buddhism O
, O
Pure B-KP
Land I-KP
, O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
utmost O
trust O
in O
the O
salvific O
`` O
other O
power O
'' O
of O
Amitabha B-KP
Buddha O
. O

Pure O
Land O
Buddhism O
is O
a O
very O
widespread O
and O
perhaps O
the O
most O
faith O
orientated O
manifestation O
of O
Buddhism O
and O
centres O
upon O
the O
conviction O
that O
faith O
in O
Amitabha O
Buddha O
and O
the O
chanting O
of O
homage O
to O
his O
name O
liberates O
one O
at O
death O
into O
the O
Blissful O
( O
) O
, O
Pure O
Land O
( O
) O
of O
Amitabha O
Buddha O
. O

This O
Buddhic O
realm O
is O
variously O
construed O
as O
a O
foretaste O
of O
Nirvana O
, O
or O
as O
essentially O
Nirvana O
itself O
. O

The O
great O
vow O
of O
Amitabha O
Buddha O
to O
rescue O
all O
beings O
from O
samsaric O
suffering O
is O
viewed O
within O
Pure O
Land O
Buddhism O
as O
universally O
efficacious O
, O
if O
only O
one O
has O
faith O
in O
the O
power O
of O
that O
vow O
or O
chants O
his O
name O
. O

Buddhists O
believe O
Gautama B-KP
Buddha I-KP
was O
the O
first O
to O
achieve O
enlightenment O
in O
this O
Buddha O
era O
and O
is O
therefore O
credited O
with O
the O
establishment O
of O
Buddhism O
. O

A B-KP
Buddha I-KP
era I-KP
is O
the O
stretch O
of O
history O
during O
which O
people O
remember O
and O
practice O
the O
teachings O
of O
the O
earliest O
known O
Buddha O
. O

This O
Buddha O
era O
will O
end O
when O
all O
the O
knowledge O
, O
evidence O
and O
teachings O
of O
Gautama O
Buddha O
have O
vanished O
. O

This O
belief O
therefore O
maintains O
that O
many O
Buddha O
eras O
have O
started O
and O
ended O
throughout O
the O
course O
of O
human O
existence O

The O
Buddhist B-KP

the O

that O

the O

There O
are O
many O
variations O
in O
the O
style O
of O
meditation O
, O
from O
sitting O
cross O
legged O
or O
kneeling O
to O
chanting O
or O
walking O
. O

The O
most O
common O
method O
of O
meditation O
is O
to O
concentrate O
on O
one O
's O
breath O
( O
anapanasati O
) O
, O
because O
this O
practice O
can O
lead O
to O
both O
samatha O
and O
vipassana O
' O
. O

In O
Buddhist O
practice O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
while O
samatha O
meditation O
can O
calm O
the O
mind B-KP
, O
only O
vipassan O
meditation O
can O
reveal O
how O
the O
mind O
was O
disturbed B-KP
to O
start O
with O
, O
which O
is O
what O
leads O
to O
insight O
knowledge O
( O

P O
li O
a O
) O
and O
understanding B-KP
( O
praj B-KP
P O
li O

) O
, O
and O
thus O
can O
lead O
to O
nirv O
a O
( O
P O
li O
nibb O
na O
) O
. O

When O
one O
is O
in O
jhana O
, O
all O
defilements O
are O
suppressed O
temporarily O
. O

Only O
understanding O
( O
praj O
or O
vipassana O
) O
eradicates O
the O
defilements O
completely O
. O

Jhanas O
are O
also O
states O
that O
Arahants O
abide O
in O
order O
to O
rest O
. O

In O
Therav O
da O
Buddhism O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
human O
existence O
and O
suffering O
is O
identified O
as O
craving B-KP
, O
which O
carries O
with O
it O
the O
various O
defilements B-KP
. O

These O
various O
defilements O
are O
traditionally O
summed O
up O
as O
greed O
, O
hatred O
and O
delusion O
. O

These O
are O
believed O
deeply O
rooted O
afflictions O
of O
the O
mind O
that O
create O
suffering B-KP
and I-KP
stress I-KP
. O

To O
be O
free O
from O
suffering O
and O
stress O
, O
these O
defilements O
must O
be O
permanently O
uprooted O
through O
internal O
investigation O
, O
analyzing O
, O
experiencing O
, O
and O
understanding O
of O
the O
true O
nature O
of O
those O
defilements O
by O
using O

Tantric O
Buddhism O

The O

According O

the O

K.R O

The O
history O
of O
Indian O
Buddhism O
may O
be O
divided O
into O
five B-KP
periods O
: O
Early B-KP
Buddhism I-KP
( O
occasionally O
called O
Pre O
sectarian O
Buddhism O
) O
, O
Nikaya O
Buddhism O
or O
Sectarian B-KP
Buddhism O

The O
period O
of O
the O
Early O
Buddhist O
schools O
, O
Early O
Mahayana O
Buddhism O
, O
Later O
Mahayana O
Buddhism O
, O
and O
Esoteric B-KP
Buddhism I-KP
( O
also O
called O
Vajrayana B-KP
Buddhism O
) O
. O

Pre B-KP
sectarian I-KP
Buddhism O
is O
the O
earliest O
phase O
of O
Buddhism O
, O
recognized O
by O
nearly O
all O
scholars O
. O

Its O
main O
scriptures O
are O
the O
Vinaya O
Pitaka O
and O
the O
four O
principal O
Nikayas O
or O
Agamas O
. O

Certain O
basic O
teachings O
appear O
in O
many O
places O
throughout O
the O
early O
texts O
, O
so O
most O
scholars O
conclude O
that O
Gautama O
Buddha O
must O
have O
taught O
something O
similar O
to O
the O
Three O
marks O
of O
existence O
, O
the O
Five O
Aggregates O
, O
dependent O
origination O
, O
karma O
and O
rebirth B-KP
, O
the O
Four O
Noble O
Truths O
, O
the O
Noble B-KP
Eightfold I-KP
Path O
, O
and O
nirvana O
. O

Some O
scholars O
disagree O
, O
and O
have O
proposed O
many O
other O
theories O
. O

According O
to O
the O
scriptures O
, O
soon O
after O
the O
parinirv O
a O
( O
from O
Sanskrit O
: O
`` O
highest O
extinguishment O
'' O
) O
of O
Gautama O
Buddha O
, O
the O
first O
Buddhist B-KP
council O
was O
held O
. O

As O
with O
any O
ancient O
Indian O
tradition O
, O
transmission O
of O
teaching O
was O
done O
orally O
. O

The O
primary O
purpose O
of O
the O
assembly O
was O
to O
collectively O
recite O
the O
teachings O
to O
ensure O
that O
no O
errors O
occurred O
in O
oral O
transmission O
. O

In O
the O
first O
council O
, O
nanda O
, O
a O
cousin O
of O
the O
Buddha O
and O
his O
personal O
attendant O
, O
was O
called O
upon O
to O
recite O
the O
discourses O
( O

of O

Up O
li O
, O
another O
disciple O
, O
recited O
the O
monastic O
rules O
( O

Most O
scholars O
regard O
the O
traditional O
accounts O
of O
the O
council O
as O
greatly O
exaggerated O
if O

entirely O
fictitious O

and O
something O
similar O
to O
the O
First O
Council O
must O
have O
taken O
place O
to O
compose O
Buddhist O
scriptures O
. O

According O
to O
most O
scholars O
, O
at O
some O
period O
after O
the B-KP
Second I-KP
Council I-KP
the O
Sangha O
began O
to O
break O
into O
separate O
factions O
. O

[ O

The O
various O
accounts O
differ O
as O
to O
when O
the O
actual O
schisms O
occurred O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Dipavamsa O
of O
the O
P O

tradition O
, O
they O
started O
immediately O
after O
the O
Second O
Council O
, O
the O
Puggalavada O
tradition O

AN O
, O
the O
Sarvastivada O
tradition O
of O
Vasumitra O
says O
it O
was O
in O
the O
time O
of O
Ashoka O
and O
the O
Mahasanghika O
tradition O
places O
it O
much O
later O
, O
nearly O
100 B-KP
BCE I-KP
. O

The O
root O
schism O
was O
between O
the O
Sthaviras O
and O
the O
Mah O
s O
ghikas O
. O

The O
fortunate O
survival O
of O
accounts O
from O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
dispute O
reveals O
disparate O
traditions O
. O

The O
Sthavira O
group O
offers O
two O
quite O
distinct O
reasons O
for O
the O
schism O
. O

The O
Dipavamsa O
of O
the O
Therav O
da O
says O
that O
the O
losing O
party O
in O
the O
Second O
Council O
dispute O
broke O
away O
in O
protest O
and O
formed O
the O
Mahasanghika B-KP
. O

This O
contradicts O
the O
Mahasanghikas B-KP
' O
own O
vinaya O
, O
which O
shows O
them O
as O
on O
the O
same O
, O
winning O
side O
. O

The O
Mah O
s O
ghikas O
argued O
that O
the O
Sthaviras O
were O
trying O
to O
expand O
the B-KP
vinaya I-KP
and O
may O
also O
have O
challenged O
what O
they O
perceived O
were O
excessive O
claims O
or O
inhumanly O
high O
criteria O
for O
arhatship O
. O

Both O
parties O
, O
therefore O
, O
appealed O
to O
tradition O
. O

The O
Sthaviras B-KP
gave O
rise O
to O
several O
schools O
, O
one O
of O
which O
was O
the O
Therav O
da O
school O
. O

Originally O
, O
these O
schisms O
were O
caused O
by O
disputes O
over O
vinaya O
, O
and O
monks O
following O
different O
schools O
of O
thought O
seem O
to O
have O
lived O
happily O
together O
in O
the O
same O
monasteries B-KP
, O
but O
eventually O
, O
by O
about O
100 O
CE O
if O
not O
earlier O
, O
schisms O
were O
being O
caused O
by O
doctrinal B-KP
disagreements O
too O
. O

Following O
( O
or O
leading O
up O
to O
) O
the O
schisms O
, O
each O
Sa O
gha O
started O
to O
accumulate O
an O
Abhidharma B-KP
, O
a O
detailed O
scholastic O
reworking O
of O
doctrinal O
material O
appearing O
in O
the O
Suttas O
, O
according O
to O
schematic O
classifications O
. O

These O
Abhidharma O
texts O
do O
not O
contain O
systematic O
philosophical O
treatises O
, O
but O
summaries B-KP
or I-KP
numerical I-KP
lists I-KP
. O

Scholars O
generally O
date O
these O
texts O
to O
around O
the O
3rd B-KP
century I-KP
BCE I-KP
, O
100 O
to O
200 O
years O
after O
the O
death O
of O
the O
Buddha O
. O

Therefore O
the O
seven O
Abhidharma O
works O
are O
generally O
claimed O
not O
to O
represent O
the O
words O
of O
the O
Buddha O
himself O
, O
but O
those O
of O
disciples O
and O
great O
scholars O
. O

[ O

Every O
school O
had O
its O
own O
version O
of O
the O
Abhidharma O
, O
with O
different O
theories O
and O
different O
texts O
. O

The O
different O
Abhidharmas O
of O
the O
various O
schools O
did O
not O
agree O
with O
each O
other O
. O

Scholars O
disagree O
on O
whether O
the O
Mahasanghika B-KP
school O
had O
an O
Abhidhamma O
Pitaka O
or O
not O

Paul O

The O

It O
is O

The O

The O

been O
seen O
by O
some O

as O

Over O

In O
the O

to O

but O
a O
number O

had O

According O
to O
some O
sources O
, O
some O
early O
schools O
of O
Buddhism O
had O
five B-KP

seven I-KP

According O
to O
the O
scriptures O
, O
soon O
after O
the O
death O
of O
the O

, O
the O
first O
Buddhist O
council O
was O
held O

a O

named O

( O

These O
became O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
Tripitaka O

However O
, O
this O
record O
was O
initially O
transmitted O
orally O
in O
form O
of O

and O
was O
committed O
to O

in O
the O
last O

. O

Both O
the O
s O
tras O
and O
the O

of O
every O
Buddhist O
school O
contain O
a O
wide O

of O
elements O

Much O
of O
the O
material O
in O
the O
Canon O
is O
not O
specifically O
`` O
Theravadin B-KP

, O
but O
is O
instead O
the O

that O
this O

preserved O

non O

it O

orthodoxy O

He O
states O
: O
`` O

they O

The O
Mahayana B-KP
sutras I-KP
are O
a O
very O
broad O
genre O
of O
Buddhist O
scriptures O
that O
the O
Mahayana O
Buddhist O
tradition O
holds O
are O
original O
teachings O
of O
the O
Buddha O
. O

Some O
adherents O
of O
Mahayana O
accept O
both O
the O
early O
teachings O
( O
including O
in O
this O
the O
Sarvastivada B-KP
Abhidharma I-KP
, O
which O
was O
criticized O
by O
Nagarjuna O
and O
is O
in O
fact O
opposed O
to O
early O
Buddhist O
thought O
) O
and O
the O
Mahayana O
sutras O
as O
authentic O
teachings O
of O
Gautama O
Buddha O
, O
and O
claim O
they O
were O
designed O
for O
different O
types O
of O
persons O
and O
different O
levels O
of O
spiritual O
understanding O
. O

The O
Mahayana B-KP
sutras O
often O
claim O
to O
articulate O
the O
Buddha O
's O
deeper O
, O
more O
advanced O
doctrines O
, O
reserved O
for O
those O
who O
follow O
the O
bodhisattva B-KP
path I-KP
. O

That O
path O
is O
explained O
as O
being O
built O
upon O
the O
motivation O
to O
liberate O
all O
living O
beings O
from O
unhappiness O

Hence O
the O
name O

( O

According O
to O
Mahayana B-KP
tradition I-KP
, O
the O
Mahayana O
sutras O
were O
transmitted O
in O

came O
from O
other O
Buddhas O
or O
Bodhisattvas O
, O

were O
preserved O

Approximately O
six B-KP
hundred I-KP
Mahayana O
sutras O
have O
survived O
in O
Sanskrit O
or O
in O
Chinese O
or O
Tibetan O
translations O

In O

, O
East B-KP
Asian I-KP
Buddhism I-KP
recognizes O
some O
sutras O
regarded O
by O
scholars O
as O
of O
Chinese O
rather O
than O
Indian O
origin O
. O

Generally O
, O
scholars O
conclude O
that O
the O
Mahayana O
scriptures O
were O
composed O
from O
the O
1st O
century O
CE O
onwards O
: O
`` O
Large O
numbers O

era O

the O
fifth O

'' O
, O
five O
centuries O
after O
the O
historical O
Gautama O

Some O
of O
these O
had O
their O
roots O
in O
other O
scriptures O
composed O
in O
the O
1st O
century O
BCE O
. O

It O
was O
not O
until O
after B-KP
the I-KP
5th I-KP
century I-KP
CE I-KP
that O
the O
Mahayana O
sutras O
started O
to O
influence O
the O
behavior O
of O
mainstream O
Buddhists O
in O
India O
: O
`` O
But O
outside O
of O
texts O
, O
at O
least O
in O
India O
, O
at O
exactly O
the O
same O
period O

very O
different O

Hinnayana O
groups O

to O

the O
only O
ones O

'' O

These O
texts O
were O
apparently O
not O
universally O
accepted O
among O
Indian O
Buddhists O
when O
they O
appeared O
; O
the O
pejorative O
label O
Hinayana B-KP
was O
applied O
by O
Mahayana O
supporters O
to O
those O
who O
rejected O
the O
Mahayana O

Only O
the B-KP
Theravada I-KP
school O
does O
not O
include O
the O

canon O

As O
the O
modern O
Theravada O
school O
is O
descended O
from O
a O
branch O
of O
Buddhism O
that O
diverged O
and O
established O
itself O
in O
Sri B-KP
Lanka I-KP
prior O
to O
the O
emergence O
of O
the O
Mahayana O
texts O
, O
debate O
exists O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
Theravada O
were O
historically O
included O
in O
the O
hinayana B-KP

in O
the O
modern O

this O

as O

is O
generally O

Scholar O
Isabelle O
Onians O
asserts O
that O

`` O

notes O
that O

more O

much O
more O
usual O
'' O
term O
used O

Jonathan O
Silk O
has O
argued O
that O
the O
term O
`` O
Hinayana B-KP
'' O
was O
used O
to O
refer O
to O
whomever O
one O
wanted O
to O
criticize O
on O
any O
given O
occasion O
, O
and O
did O
not O
refer O

Buddhism B-KP
provides O
many O
opportunities O
for O
comparative O
study O
with O
a O
diverse O
range O
of O
subjects O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Buddhism O
's O
emphasis O
on O
the O
Middle O
way O
not O
only O
provides O
a O
unique O
guideline O
for O
ethics B-KP
but O
has O
also O
allowed O
Buddhism O
to O
peacefully O
coexist O
with O
various O
differing O
beliefs O
, O
customs O
and O
institutions O
in O
countries O
where O
it O
has O
resided O
throughout O
its O
history O

Also O
, O
its O
moral B-KP

spiritual I-KP
parallels O
with O
other O
systems O
of O
thought O
for O
example O
, O
with O
various O
tenets O
of O
Christianity B-KP
have O
been O
subjects O
of O
close O
study O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
Buddhist O
concept O
of O
dependent O
origination O
has O
been O
compared O
to O
modern O
scientific B-KP
thought O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Western O
metaphysics O
. O

There O
are O
differences O
of O
opinion O
on O
the O
question O
of O
whether O

not O
Buddhism B-KP

be O
considered O

Canis O
is O
a O
Latin O

carnivores O
: O
the O
domestic O

recorded O
the O
wolf B-KP

In O
1978 O
, O
a O
review O
aimed O
at O
reducing O
the O

at O

an O
English B-KP

The O
coats O
of O
domestic O
dogs O
are O
of O
two O
varieties O
: O
`` O
double B-KP

being O
common O
with O
dogs O
( O
as O

Domestic O
dogs O
often O
display O
the O
remnants O
of O
countershading B-KP
, O
a O
common O
natural O
camouflage O
pattern O
. O

A O
countershaded O
animal O
will O
have O
dark B-KP
coloring I-KP
on O
its O
upper B-KP
surfaces I-KP
and O
light O
coloring O
below O
, O
which O
reduces O
its O
general O
visibility B-KP

Thus O
, O
many O
breeds O
will O
have O
an O
occasional O
`` O
blaze O
'' O
, O
stripe O

or O
`` O
star O

of O
white O

tails B-KP
: O
straight O

curled O
, O
or O
cork O

As O
with O
many O
canids O
, O
one O
of O
the O
primary O
functions O
of O
a O
dog O
's O
tail O
is O
to O
communicate O
their O
emotional B-KP
state I-KP
, O
which O
can O
be O
important O
in O
getting O
along O
with O
others O
. O

In O
some O
hunting O
dogs O
, O
however O
, O
the O
tail O
is O
traditionally O
docked O
to O
avoid O
injuries O
. O

In O
some O
breeds O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Braque O
du O
Bourbonnais O
, O
puppies O
can O
be O
born O
with O
a O
short O
tail O
or O
no O
tail O
at O
all O
. O

Some O
breeds O
of O
dogs O
are O
prone O
to O
certain O
genetic B-KP
ailments I-KP
such O
as O
elbow O
and O
hip O
dysplasia O
, O
blindness O
, O
deafness O
, O
pulmonic O
stenosis O
, O
cleft O
palate O
, O
and O
trick O
knees O

Two O
serious O
medical O
conditions O
particularly O
affecting O
dogs O
are O
pyometra O
, O
affecting O
unspayed B-KP
females I-KP
of O
all O
types O
and O
ages O
, O
and O
bloat O
, O
which O
affects O
the O
larger O
breeds O
or O
deep O
chested O
dogs O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
are O
acute O
conditions O
, O
and O
can O
kill O
rapidly O
. O

Dogs O
are O
also O
susceptible O
to O
parasites B-KP
such O
as O
fleas O
, O
ticks O
, O
and O
mites O
, O
as O
well O
as O
hookworms O
, O
tapeworms O

A O
number O
of O
common O
human O
foods O
and O
household O
ingestibles O
are O
toxic B-KP
to O
dogs O
, O
including O
chocolate O
solids O
( O
theobromine B-KP
poisoning O
) O
, O
onion O
and O
garlic O
( O
thiosulphate O

, O
grapes O

raisins O
, O
macadamia B-KP
nuts O
, O
xylitol B-KP
, O
as O
well O
as O
various O
plants O
and O
other O
potentially O
ingested O
materials O
. O

The O
nicotine B-KP
in O
tobacco O
can O
also O
be O
dangerous O
. O

Dogs O
can O
get O
it O
by O
scavenging O
in O
garbage O
or O
ashtrays O
; O
eating O
cigars O
and O
cigarettes O
. O

Signs O
can O
be O
vomiting O
of O
large O
amounts O
( O
e.g. O
, O
from O
eating O
cigar O
butts O
) O
or O
diarrhea O
. O

Some O
other O
signs O
are O
abdominal O
pain O
, O
loss O
of O
coordination O
, O
collapse O
, O
or O
death O
. O

Dogs O
are O
highly O
susceptible O
to O
theobromine O
poisoning O
, O
typically O
from O
ingestion O
of O
chocolate O
. O

Theobromine O
is O
toxic O
to O
dogs O
because O
, O
although O
the O
dog O
's O
metabolism O
is O
capable O
of O
breaking O
down O
the O
chemical O
, O
the O
process O
is O
so O
slow O
that O
even O
small O
amounts O
of O
chocolate O
can O
be O
fatal O
, O
especially O
dark B-KP
chocolate O
. O

In O
2013 B-KP
, O
a O
study O
found O
that O
mixed O
breeds O
live O
on O
average O
1.2 B-KP

and O
that O
increasing O
body O

There O
have O
been O
two B-KP
major O
trends O

the O
changing O

The O
first O
has O
been O
the O
'commodification O
' O
of O
the O
dog O
, O
shaping O
it O
to O
conform O
to O
human O
expectations O
of O
personality O

. O

The O
second O
has O
been O
the O
broadening O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
family O
and O
the O
home O
to O
include O
dogs O
as O
dogs O
within O
everyday B-KP
routines I-KP
and O
practices O
. O

There O
are O
a O
vast O
range O
of O
commodity B-KP
forms I-KP
available O
to O
transform O
a O
pet O
dog O
into O
an O
ideal O
companion O

The O
list O
of O
goods O

places O

While O
dog O
training B-KP
as O
an O
organized O
activity O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
to O
the O
18th B-KP
century I-KP
, O
in O
the O
last O
decades O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
it O
became O
a O
high O
profile O
issue O
as O
many O
normal O
dog O
behaviors O
such O
as O

up O

and O

marking I-KP
( O
which O

, O
became O
increasingly O
incompatible O
with O
the O
new O
role O
of O
a O
pet O
dog O
. O

Dog O
training O
books O
, O
classes O
and O
television O
programs O
proliferated O
as O
the O
process O
of O
commodifying O
the O
pet O

continued O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
contemporary O
people O
with O
dogs O
describe O
their O
pet O
as O
part B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
family I-KP
, O
although O
some O
ambivalence O
about O
the O
relationship O
is O
evident O
in O
the O
popular O
reconceptualization O
of O
the O
dog O
human O
family O
as O
a O
pack O
. O

A O
dominance O
model O
of O
dog O
human O
relationships O
has O
been O
promoted O
by O
some O
dog O
trainers O
, O
such O
as O
on O
the O
television O
program O
Dog B-KP
Whisperer I-KP
. I-KP

However O
it O
has O
been O
disputed O
that O
`` O
trying O
to O
achieve O
status O
'' O
is O
characteristic O
of O
dog O
human O
interactions O
. O

Pet O
dogs O
play O
an O
active O
role O
in O
family O
life O
; O
for O
example O
, O
a O
study O
of O
conversations O
in O

how O

a O
resource O

with O
each O

Another O
study O
of O
dogs O
' O
roles O
in O
families O
showed O
many O
dogs O
have O
set B-KP
tasks I-KP

undertaken O
as O
family O
members O

the O
most O

A O
2005 B-KP
paper O
states O
`` O
recent O
research O
has O
failed O
to O

that O

any O
psychological O

physical O
benefits O
on O
health O
for O
community O

older O

. O

Research O
has O
, O
however O
, O
pointed O
to O
significantly O
less O
absenteeism B-KP
from I-KP
school I-KP
through O
sickness O
among O

who O
live O
with O

'' O

In O
one O
study O
, O
new O
guardians O
reported O
a O
highly O
significant O
reduction O
in O
minor O
health O
problems O
during O
the O
first O
month O
following O
pet O
acquisition O
, O
and O
this O
effect O
was O
sustained O
in O
those O
with O
dogs O
through O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
study O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
people O
with O
pet O
dogs O
took O
considerably O
more O
physical O
exercise B-KP
than O
those O
with O
cats O
and O
those O
without O

. O

The O
results O
provide O
evidence O
that O
keeping O
pets O
may O
have O
positive O
effects O
on O
human O
health O
and O
behaviour O
, O
and O
that O
for O
guardians O
of O
dogs O
these O
effects O
are O
relatively O
long O
term O

Pet O
guardianship O
has O
also O
been O
associated O
with O
increased O
coronary O

survival O
, O
with O
human O
guardians O
being O
significantly O
less O
likely O
to O
die O
within O
one O
year O
of O
an O
acute O
myocardial O

than O
those O
who O
did O
not O
own O

. O

The O
health O
benefits O
of O
dogs O
can O
result O
from O
contact O
with O
dogs O
in O
general O
, O
and O
not O
solely O
from O
having O
dogs O
as O
pets O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
pet O

, O
people O
show O
reductions O
in O
cardiovascular O
, O
behavioral O
, O
and O
psychological O
indicators O
of O
anxiety B-KP
. O

Other O
health O
benefits O
are O
gained O
from O
exposure O
to O
immune B-KP
stimulating I-KP
microorganisms I-KP
, O
which O
, O
according O
to O
the O
hygiene O
hypothesis O
, O
can O
protect O

allergies O
and O
autoimmune O
diseases O
. O

The O
benefits O
of O
contact O
with O
a O
dog O
also O
include O
social O
support O
, O
as O
dogs O
are O
able O
to O
not O
only O
provide O
companionship O
and O
social O
support O
themselves O
, O
but O
also O
to O
act O
as O
facilitators O
of O
social B-KP
interactions I-KP
between O
humans O
. O

One O
study O
indicated O
that O
wheelchair O
users O
experience O
more O
positive O
social O
interactions O
with O

when O
they O
are O
accompanied O
by O
a O

than O
when O
they O

In O
2015 B-KP
, O
a O

found O
that O
pet O

The B-KP
essay I-KP
from I-KP
which I-KP
Aims I-KP
of I-KP
Education I-KP
derived I-KP
its I-KP
name I-KP
was I-KP
delivered I-KP
as I-KP
an I-KP
address I-KP
in I-KP
1916 I-KP
when O
Whitehead O
was O
president O
of O
the O
London O
Branch O
of O
the O
Mathematical O
Association O
. O

In O
it O
, O
he O
cautioned O
against O
the O
teaching O
of O
what O
he O
called O
`` O
inert B-KP
ideas I-KP
'' O
ideas B-KP
that I-KP
are I-KP
disconnected I-KP
scraps I-KP
of I-KP
information I-KP
, I-KP
with I-KP
no I-KP
application I-KP
to I-KP
real I-KP
life I-KP
or I-KP
culture I-KP

He O
opined O
that O
`` O
education O
with O
inert O
ideas O
is O
not O
only O
useless O
: O
it O
is O
, O
above O
all O

'' O

Rather O
than O
teach O
small O
parts O
of O
a O
large O
number O
of O
subjects O
, O
Whitehead B-KP
advocated I-KP
teaching I-KP
a B-KP
relatively I-KP
few I-KP
important I-KP
concepts I-KP
that I-KP
the I-KP
student I-KP
could I-KP
organically I-KP
link I-KP
to I-KP
many I-KP
different B-KP
areas I-KP
of I-KP
knowledge I-KP
, I-KP
discovering I-KP
their I-KP
application I-KP
in I-KP
actual I-KP
life I-KP
. I-KP

For B-KP
Whitehead I-KP
, I-KP
education I-KP
should I-KP
be I-KP
the I-KP
exact I-KP
opposite I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
multidisciplinary I-KP
, I-KP
value B-KP
free I-KP
school I-KP
model I-KP
it B-KP
should I-KP
be I-KP
transdisciplinary I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
laden I-KP
with I-KP
values I-KP
and I-KP
general I-KP
principles I-KP
that I-KP
provide I-KP
students I-KP
with I-KP
a I-KP
bedrock I-KP
of I-KP
wisdom I-KP
and O
help O
them O
to O
make O
connections O
between O
areas O
of O
knowledge O
that O
are O
usually O
regarded O
as O
separate O
. O

Whitehead O
did O
not O
begin O
his O
career O
as O
a O
philosopher O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
he B-KP
never I-KP
had I-KP
any I-KP
formal I-KP
training I-KP
in I-KP
philosophy I-KP
beyond I-KP
his I-KP
undergraduate B-KP
education I-KP
. O

Early O
in O
his O
life O
he O
showed O
great O
interest O
in O
and O
respect O
for O
philosophy O
and O
metaphysics O
, O
but O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
he O
considered O
himself O
a O
rank B-KP
amateur I-KP
. O

In O
one O
letter O
to O
his O
friend B-KP
and I-KP
former I-KP
student I-KP
Bertrand B-KP
Russell I-KP
, O
after O
discussing O
whether O
science O
aimed O
to O
be O
explanatory O
or O
merely O
descriptive O
, O
he O
wrote O
: O
`` O
This O
further O
question O
lands O
us O
in O
the O
ocean O
of O
metaphysic O
, O
onto O
which O
my O
profound O
ignorance O
of O
that O
science O
forbids O
me O
to O
enter O
. O
'' O

Ironically O
, O
in B-KP
later I-KP
life I-KP
Whitehead I-KP
would I-KP
become I-KP
one B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
20th I-KP
century I-KP
's I-KP
foremost I-KP
metaphysicians I-KP
. I-KP

Whitehead O
was O
unimpressed O
by O
this O
objection O
. O

In O
the O
notes O
of O
one O
his O
students O
for O
a O
1927 O
class O
, O
Whitehead O
was O
quoted O
as O
saying O
: O
`` O
Every O
scientific O
man O
in O
order O
to O
preserve O
his O
reputation O
has O
to O
say O
he O
dislikes O
metaphysics O
. O

What O
he O
means O
is O
he O
dislikes O
having O
his O
metaphysics O
criticized O
. O
'' O

In O
Whitehead O
's O
view O
, O
scientists O
and O
philosophers O
make B-KP
metaphysical I-KP
assumptions I-KP
about I-KP
how I-KP
the I-KP
universe I-KP
works I-KP
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
such B-KP
assumptions I-KP
are I-KP
not I-KP
easily I-KP
seen I-KP
precisely I-KP
because I-KP
they B-KP
remain I-KP
unexamined I-KP
and I-KP
unquestioned I-KP
. O

While O
Whitehead O
acknowledged O
that O
`` O
philosophers O
can O
never O
hope O
finally O
to O
formulate O
these O
metaphysical O
first O
principles O
, O
'' O
he O
argued O
that O
people B-KP
need I-KP
to I-KP
continually I-KP
re I-KP
imagine I-KP
their I-KP
basic B-KP
assumptions I-KP
about I-KP
how I-KP
the I-KP
universe I-KP
works I-KP
if I-KP
philosophy I-KP
and I-KP
science I-KP
are I-KP
to I-KP
make I-KP
any I-KP
real I-KP
progress I-KP
, O
even O
if O
that O
progress O
remains O
permanently O
asymptotic O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
Whitehead B-KP
regarded I-KP
metaphysical B-KP
investigations I-KP
as I-KP
essential I-KP
to I-KP
both I-KP
good I-KP
science I-KP
and I-KP
good I-KP
philosophy I-KP
. O

Perhaps O
foremost O
among O
what O
Whitehead O
considered O
faulty O
metaphysical O
assumptions O
was O
the O
Cartesian B-KP
idea I-KP
that O
reality B-KP
is I-KP
fundamentally I-KP
constructed I-KP
of I-KP
bits I-KP
of I-KP
matter I-KP
that I-KP
exist I-KP
totally I-KP
independently I-KP
of I-KP
one I-KP
another I-KP
, O
which O
he O
rejected O
in O
favor O
of O
an B-KP
event I-KP
based I-KP
or I-KP
`` I-KP
process I-KP
'' I-KP
ontology I-KP
in I-KP
which I-KP
events I-KP
are I-KP
primary I-KP
and I-KP
are I-KP
fundamentally I-KP
interrelated B-KP
and I-KP
dependent I-KP
on I-KP
one I-KP
another I-KP
. O

He O
also O
argued O
that O
the O
most O
basic O
elements O
of O
reality O
can O
all O
be O
regarded O
as O
experiential B-KP
, O
indeed O
that O
everything O
is O
constituted O
by O
its O
experience O
. O

He B-KP
used I-KP
the I-KP
term I-KP
`` I-KP
experience I-KP
'' I-KP
very I-KP
broadly I-KP
, I-KP
so I-KP
that I-KP
even I-KP
inanimate I-KP
processes I-KP
such I-KP
as I-KP
electron I-KP
collisions I-KP
are I-KP
said I-KP
to I-KP
manifest I-KP
some I-KP
degree I-KP
of I-KP
experience I-KP
. O

In O
this O
, O
he O
went O
against O
Descartes O
' O
separation O
of O
two B-KP
different I-KP
kinds I-KP
of I-KP
real I-KP
existence I-KP
, I-KP
either I-KP
exclusively I-KP
material I-KP
or I-KP
else I-KP
exclusively I-KP
mental I-KP
. O

Whitehead O
referred O
to O
his O
metaphysical O
system O
as O
`` O
philosophy O
of O
organism O
'' O
, O
but O
it O
would O
become O
known O
more O
widely O
as O
`` O
process B-KP
philosophy I-KP
. O
'' O

In O
Whitehead O
's O
view O
, O
then O
, O
concepts O
such O
as O
`` O
quality B-KP
'' I-KP
, I-KP
`` I-KP
matter I-KP
'' I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
`` I-KP
form I-KP
'' I-KP
are O
problematic O
. O

These B-KP
`` I-KP
classical I-KP
'' I-KP
concepts I-KP
fail I-KP
to I-KP
adequately I-KP
account I-KP
for I-KP
change B-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
overlook I-KP
the I-KP
active I-KP
and I-KP
experiential I-KP
nature I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
most I-KP
basic I-KP
elements I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
. I-KP

They O
are O
useful O
abstractions O
, O
but O
are O
not O
the O
world O
's O
basic O
building O
blocks O
. O

What O
is O
ordinarily O
conceived O
of O
as O
a O
single O
person O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
philosophically O
described O
as O
a B-KP
continuum B-KP
of I-KP
overlapping I-KP
events I-KP
. O

After O
all O
, O
people O
change O
all O
the O
time O
, O
if O
only O
because O
they O
have O
aged O
by O
another O
second O
and O
had O
some O
further O
experience O
. O

These O
occasions O
of O
experience O
are O
logically O
distinct O
, O
but O
are O
progressively O
connected O
in O
what O
Whitehead O
calls O
a B-KP
`` I-KP
society B-KP
'' I-KP
of I-KP
events I-KP
. O

By B-KP
assuming I-KP
that I-KP
enduring I-KP
objects I-KP
are I-KP
the I-KP
most I-KP
real I-KP
and I-KP
fundamental I-KP
things I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
universe I-KP
, I-KP
materialists I-KP
have I-KP
mistaken I-KP
the I-KP
abstract I-KP
for I-KP
the I-KP
concrete I-KP
( O
what O
Whitehead O
calls O
the O
`` O
fallacy O
of O

'' O
) O
. O

To O
put O
it O
another O
way O
, O
a O
thing O
or O
person O
is O
often O
seen O
as O
having O
a O
`` O
defining B-KP
essence I-KP
'' O
or O
a O
`` O
core O
identity O
'' O
that O
is O
unchanging O
, O
and O
describes O
what O
the O
thing O
or O
person O
really O
is O
. O

In O
this O
way O
of O
thinking O
, O
things O
and O
people O
are O
seen O
as O
fundamentally O
the O
same O
through O
time O

with O
any O

qualitative B-KP

across O

Identities O
do O
not O
define O

, O
people B-KP
define I-KP

Everything O
changes O
from O

to O
moment O
, O
and O
to O
think O
of O
anything O
as O
having O
an O
`` O

the O
fact O
that O
`` O
all B-KP
things I-KP
flow I-KP
'' I-KP
, O
though O
it O
is O
often O
a O
useful O
way O
of O
speaking O
. O

Whitehead O
pointed O
to O
the O
limitations B-KP
of I-KP
language I-KP
as O
one O
of O
the O
main O
culprits O
in O
maintaining O
a O
materialistic O
way O
of O
thinking O
, O
and O
acknowledged O
that O
it O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
ever O
wholly O
move O
past O
such O
ideas O
in O
everyday O
speech O
. O

After O
all O
, O
each O
moment O
of O
each O
person O
's O
life O
can O
hardly O
be O
given O
a O
different O
proper O
name O
, O
and O
it B-KP
is I-KP
easy I-KP
and I-KP
convenient I-KP
to I-KP
think I-KP
of I-KP
people I-KP
and I-KP
objects I-KP
as I-KP
remaining I-KP
fundamentally I-KP
the I-KP
same I-KP
things I-KP
, O
rather O
than O
constantly O
keeping O
in O
mind O
that O
each B-KP
thing I-KP
is I-KP
a I-KP
different I-KP
thing I-KP
from I-KP
what I-KP
it I-KP
was I-KP
a I-KP
moment I-KP
ago I-KP
. O

Yet O
the O
limitations O
of O
everyday O
living O
and O
everyday O
speech O
should B-KP
not I-KP
prevent I-KP
people I-KP
from I-KP
realizing I-KP
that I-KP
`` I-KP
material I-KP
substances I-KP
'' I-KP
or I-KP
`` I-KP
essences I-KP
'' I-KP
are I-KP
a I-KP
convenient I-KP
generalized I-KP
description I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
continuum I-KP
of O
particular O
, O
concrete O
processes O
. O

No O
one O
questions O
that O
a O
ten O
year O
old O
person O
is O
quite O
different O
by O
the O
time O
he O
or O
she O
turns O
thirty O
years O
old O
, O
and O
in O
many O
ways O
is O
not O
the O
same O
person O
at O
all O
; O
Whitehead O
points O
out O
that O
it B-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
philosophically I-KP
or I-KP
ontologically I-KP
sound I-KP
to O
think O
that O
a O
person O
is O
the O
same O
from O
one O
second O
to O
the O
next O
. O

A O
second O
problem O
with O
materialism B-KP
is O
that O
it B-KP
obscures I-KP
the I-KP
importance I-KP
of I-KP
relations I-KP
. O

It B-KP
sees I-KP
every I-KP
object I-KP
as I-KP
distinct B-KP
and I-KP
discrete I-KP
from I-KP
all I-KP
other I-KP
objects I-KP
. I-KP

Each B-KP
object I-KP
is I-KP
simply I-KP
an I-KP
inert I-KP
clump I-KP
of I-KP
matter I-KP
that I-KP
is I-KP
only I-KP
externally B-KP
related I-KP
to I-KP
other I-KP
things I-KP
. O

The B-KP
idea I-KP
of I-KP
matter I-KP
as I-KP
primary I-KP
makes I-KP
people I-KP
think I-KP
of I-KP
objects I-KP
as I-KP
being I-KP
fundamentally I-KP
separate I-KP
in I-KP
time I-KP
and I-KP
space I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
not I-KP
necessarily I-KP
related I-KP
to I-KP
anything I-KP
. O

But O
in B-KP
Whitehead I-KP
's I-KP
view I-KP
, I-KP
relations I-KP
take I-KP
a I-KP
primary I-KP
role I-KP
, I-KP
perhaps I-KP
even I-KP
more I-KP
important I-KP
than I-KP
the I-KP
relata I-KP
themselves I-KP
. O

A O
student O
taking O
notes O
in O
one O
of O
Whitehead O

fall O
1924 O
classes O
wrote O
that O

Beginning O
in O
the O
late O
1910s B-KP
and O
early O
1920s O
, O
Whitehead O
gradually O
turned O
his O
attention O
from O
mathematics B-KP
to O
philosophy B-KP
of I-KP
science I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
finally I-KP
to I-KP
metaphysics B-KP

He O
developed O
a O
comprehensive O
metaphysical B-KP
system O
which O
radically O
departed O
from O
most O
of O
western O
philosophy O
. O

Whitehead O
argued O
that O
reality O
consists O
of O
processes B-KP
rather O
than O
material O
objects O
, O
and O
that O
processes O
are O
best O
defined O
by O
their O
relations O

other O
processes O
, O
thus O
rejecting O
the O
theory O
that O
reality B-KP
is I-KP
fundamentally I-KP
constructed I-KP
by I-KP
bits I-KP
of I-KP
matter I-KP
that I-KP
exist I-KP
independently I-KP

another I-KP

Today O
Whitehead O

works O

as O
he O
never O

her O

However O
, O
many O
details O

remain O
obscure O
because O
he O
left O
no O

his B-KP

carried I-KP
out I-KP

It O
must O
be O
emphasized O
, O
however O
, O
that O
an B-KP
entity I-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
merely I-KP
a I-KP
sum I-KP
of I-KP
its I-KP
relations I-KP
, I-KP
but I-KP
also I-KP
a I-KP
valuation I-KP
of I-KP
them I-KP
and I-KP
reaction I-KP
to I-KP
them I-KP
. I-KP

For O
Whitehead O
, O
creativity B-KP
is I-KP
the I-KP
absolute I-KP
principle I-KP
of I-KP
existence I-KP
, O
and O
every O
entity O
( O
whether O
it O
is O
a O
human O
being O
, O
a O
tree O
, O
or O
an O
electron O
) O
has B-KP
some I-KP
degree I-KP
of I-KP
novelty I-KP
in I-KP
how I-KP
it I-KP
responds I-KP
to I-KP
other I-KP
entities I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
fully I-KP
determined I-KP
by I-KP
causal I-KP
or I-KP
mechanistic I-KP
laws I-KP
. O

Of O
course O
, O
most O
entities O
do O
not O
have O
consciousness B-KP
. O

As O
a O
human O
being O
's O
actions O
can O
not O
always O
be O
predicted O
, O
the O
same O
can O
be O
said O
of O

, O
or O
how O

will O

or O

. O

Moreover O
, O
inability O
to O
predict O
an O
electron O
's O
movement O
( O
for O
instance O
) O
is O
not O
due O
to O
faulty O
understanding O
or O
inadequate O
technology O
; O
rather O
, O
the B-KP
fundamental I-KP
creativity/freedom I-KP
of I-KP
all I-KP
entities I-KP
means O
that O
there O
will O
always O
remain O
phenomena O
that O
are O
unpredictable O
. O

Since O
Whitehead O
's O
metaphysics O
described O
a O
universe O
in O
which O
all O
entities O
experience O
, O
he O
needed O
a O
new O
way O
of O
describing O
perception O
that O
was O
not O
limited O
to O
living O
, O
self O
conscious O
beings O
. O

The O
term O
he O
coined O
was O
`` O
prehension B-KP
'' O
, O
which O
comes B-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
Latin B-KP
prehensio I-KP
, I-KP
meaning I-KP
`` I-KP
to B-KP
seize I-KP
. I-KP
'' I-KP

The O
term O
is O
meant O
to O
indicate O
a B-KP
kind I-KP
of I-KP
perception I-KP
that I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
conscious I-KP
or I-KP
unconscious I-KP
, I-KP
applying I-KP
to I-KP
people I-KP
as I-KP
well I-KP
as I-KP
electrons I-KP
. O

It O
is O
also O
intended O
to O
make O
clear O
Whitehead O
's O
rejection O
of O
the O
theory O
of O
representative O
perception O
, O
in O
which O
the B-KP
mind I-KP
only I-KP
has I-KP
private I-KP
ideas I-KP
about I-KP
other I-KP
entities I-KP
. O

For O
Whitehead O
, O
the O
term O
`` O
prehension O
'' O
indicates O
that O
the O
perceiver O
actually O
incorporates O
aspects O
of O
the O
perceived O
thing O
into O
itself O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
entities B-KP
are I-KP
constituted I-KP
by I-KP
their I-KP
perceptions I-KP
and I-KP
relations I-KP
, I-KP
rather I-KP
than I-KP
being I-KP
independent I-KP
of I-KP
them I-KP
. O

Further O
, O
Whitehead O
regards O
perception O
as O
occurring O
in O
two B-KP
modes O
, O
causal B-KP
efficacy I-KP
( I-KP
or I-KP
`` I-KP
physical I-KP
prehension I-KP
'' I-KP
) I-KP
and I-KP
presentational I-KP
immediacy I-KP
( I-KP
or I-KP
`` I-KP
conceptual I-KP
prehension I-KP
'' I-KP
) I-KP
. O

Whitehead O
describes O
causal B-KP
efficacy I-KP
as O
`` O
the O
experience O
dominating O
the O
primitive O
living O
organisms O
, O
which O
have O
a O
sense O
for O
the O
fate O
from O
which O
they O
have O
emerged O
, O
and O
the O
fate O
towards O
which O
they O
go O
. O
'' O

It O
is O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
the O
sense O
of O
causal O
relations O
between O
entities O
, O
a O
feeling O
of O
being O
influenced O
and O
affected O
by O
the O
surrounding O
environment O
, O
unmediated B-KP
by I-KP
the I-KP
senses I-KP
. O

Presentational B-KP
immediacy I-KP
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
what O
is O
usually O
referred O
to O
as O
`` O
pure O
sense O
perception O
'' O
, O
unmediated O
by O
any O
causal O
or O
symbolic O
interpretation O
, O
even O
unconscious O
interpretation O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
it B-KP
is I-KP
pure I-KP
appearance I-KP
, I-KP
which I-KP
may I-KP
or I-KP
may I-KP
not I-KP
be I-KP
delusive I-KP
( O
e.g O
. O

mistaking O
an O
image O
in O
a O
mirror O
for O
`` O
the O
real O
thing O
'' O
) O
. O

In O
higher O
organisms O
( O
like O
people O
) O
, O
these O
two O
modes O
of O
perception O
combine O
into O
what O
Whitehead O
terms O
`` O
symbolic B-KP
reference I-KP
'' O
, O
which O
links B-KP
appearance I-KP
with I-KP
causation I-KP
in I-KP
a I-KP
process I-KP
that I-KP
is I-KP
so I-KP
automatic I-KP
that I-KP
both I-KP
people I-KP
and I-KP
animals I-KP
have I-KP
difficulty I-KP
refraining I-KP
from I-KP
it I-KP
. O

By O
way O
of O
illustration O
, O
Whitehead O
uses O
the O
example O
of O
a O
person O
's O
encounter O
with O
a O
chair O
. O

An B-KP
ordinary I-KP
person I-KP
looks I-KP
up I-KP
, I-KP
sees I-KP
a I-KP
colored I-KP
shape I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
immediately I-KP
infers I-KP
that I-KP
it I-KP
is I-KP
a I-KP
chair I-KP
. O

However O
, O
an O
artist O
, O
Whitehead O
supposes O
, O
`` O
might O
not O
have O
jumped O
to O
the O
notion O
of O
a O
chair O
'' O
, O
but O
instead O
`` O
might O
have O
stopped O
at O
the O
mere O
contemplation O
of O
a O
beautiful O
color O
and O
a O
beautiful O
shape O
. O
'' O

This O
is O
not O
the O
normal O
human O
reaction O
; O
most O
people O
place O
objects O
in O
categories O
by O
habit O
and O
instinct O
, O
without O
even O
thinking O
about O
it O
. O

Moreover O
, O
animals O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Using O
the O
same O
example O
, O
Whitehead O
points O
out O
that O
a O
dog O
`` O
would O
have O
acted O
immediately O
on O
the O
hypothesis O
of O
a O
chair O
and O
would O
have O
jumped O
onto O
it O
by O
way O
of O
using O
it O
as O
such O
. O
'' O

In O
this O
way O
symbolic O
reference O
is O
a O
fusion O
of O
pure O
sense O
perceptions O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
and O
causal O
relations O
on O
the O
other O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
in O
fact O
the O
causal B-KP
relationships I-KP
that O
dominate O
the O
more O
basic O
mentality O
( O
as O
the O
dog O
illustrates O
) O
, O
while O
it O
is O
the O
sense O
perceptions O
which O
indicate O
a O
higher B-KP
grade I-KP
mentality I-KP
( O
as O
the O
artist O
illustrates O
) O
. O

Whitehead O
makes O
the O
startling O
observation O
that O
`` O
life O
is O
comparatively O
deficient O
in O
survival B-KP
value I-KP
. O
'' O

If O
humans O
can O
only O
exist O
for O
about O
a O
hundred O
years O
, O
and O
rocks O
for O
eight O
hundred O
million O
, O
then O
one O
is O
forced O
to O
ask O
why O
complex O
organisms O
ever O
evolved O
in O
the O
first O
place O
; O
as O
Whitehead O
humorously O
notes O
, O
`` O
they O
certainly O
did O
not O
appear O
because O
they O
were O
better O
at O
that O
game O
than O
the O
rocks O
around O
them O
. O
'' O

He O
then O
observes O
that O
the O
mark O
of O
higher O
forms O
of O
life O
is O
that O
they B-KP
are I-KP
actively I-KP
engaged I-KP
in I-KP
modifying B-KP
their I-KP
environment I-KP
, O
an O
activity O
which O
he O
theorizes O
is O
directed O
toward O
the O
three B-KP
fold O
goal O
of O
living B-KP
, I-KP
living I-KP
well I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
living I-KP
better I-KP
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
Whitehead O
sees O
life O
as O
directed O
toward O
the O
purpose O
of O
increasing B-KP
its I-KP
own I-KP
satisfaction I-KP
. O

Without O
such O
a O
goal O
, O
he O
sees O
the O
rise O
of O
life O
as O
totally O
unintelligible B-KP
. O

Whitehead O
's O
idea O
of O
God O
differs O
from O
traditional O
monotheistic O
notions O
. O

Perhaps O
his O
most O
famous O
and O
pointed O
criticism O
of O
the O
Christian O
conception O
of O
God O
is O
that O
`` O
the O
Church O
gave O
unto O
God O
the O
attributes O
which O
belonged O
exclusively O
to O
Caesar O
. O
'' O

Here O
Whitehead O
is O
criticizing O
Christianity O
for O
defining O
God O
as O
primarily B-KP
a I-KP
divine I-KP
king I-KP
who I-KP
imposes I-KP
his I-KP
will I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
whose I-KP
most I-KP
important I-KP
attribute I-KP
is I-KP
power I-KP
. O

As O
opposed O
to O
the O
most O
widely O
accepted O
forms O
of O
Christianity O
, O
Whitehead O
emphasized O
an O
idea O
of O
God O
that O
he O
called O
`` O
the O
brief O
Galilean O
vision O
of O
humility O
'' O
: O

It O
should O
be O
emphasized O
, O
however O
, O
that O
for O
Whitehead O
God B-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
necessarily I-KP
tied I-KP
to I-KP
religion I-KP
. O

Rather O
than O
springing O
primarily O
from O
religious O
faith O
, O
Whitehead O
saw O
God O
as O
necessary O
for O
his O
metaphysical O
system O
. O

His B-KP
system I-KP
required I-KP
that I-KP
an I-KP
order I-KP
exist I-KP
among I-KP
possibilities I-KP
, I-KP
an I-KP
order I-KP
that I-KP
allowed I-KP
for I-KP
novelty I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
and I-KP
provided I-KP
an I-KP
aim I-KP
to I-KP
all I-KP
entities I-KP
. I-KP

Whitehead O
posited O
that O
these O
ordered O
potentials O
exist O
in O
what O
he O
called O
the O
primordial B-KP
nature I-KP
of I-KP
God I-KP
. O

However O
, O
Whitehead O
was O
also O
interested O
in O
religious O
experience O
. O

This O
led O
him O
to O
reflect O
more O
intensively O
on O
what O
he O
saw O
as O
the O
second O
nature O
of O
God O
, O
the B-KP
consequent I-KP
nature I-KP
. O

Whitehead O
's O
conception O
of O
God O
as O
a O
`` O
dipolar B-KP
'' O
entity O
has O
called O
for O
fresh O
theological O
thinking O
. O

God O
's O
consequent O
nature O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
is O
anything O
but O
unchanging O
it O
is O
God B-KP
's I-KP
reception I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
's I-KP
activity I-KP
. O

As O
Whitehead O
puts O
it O
, O
`` O
[ O
God O
] O
saves O
the O
world O
as O
it O
passes O
into O
the O
immediacy O
of O
his O
own O
life O
. O

It B-KP
is I-KP
the I-KP
judgment I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
tenderness I-KP
which I-KP
loses I-KP
nothing I-KP
that I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
saved I-KP
. I-KP
'' O

In O
other O
words O
, O
God B-KP
saves I-KP
and I-KP
cherishes I-KP
all I-KP
experiences I-KP
forever I-KP
, O
and O
those B-KP
experiences I-KP
go I-KP
on I-KP
to I-KP
change I-KP
the I-KP
way I-KP
God I-KP
interacts I-KP
with I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
God B-KP
is I-KP
really I-KP
changed I-KP
by I-KP
what I-KP
happens I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
wider I-KP
universe I-KP
, I-KP
lending I-KP
the I-KP
actions I-KP
of I-KP
finite I-KP
creatures I-KP
an I-KP
eternal I-KP
significance I-KP
. I-KP

Whitehead B-KP
thus I-KP
sees I-KP
God I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
as I-KP
fulfilling I-KP
one I-KP
another I-KP
. O

He B-KP
sees I-KP
entities I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
as I-KP
fluent I-KP
and I-KP
changing I-KP
things I-KP
that I-KP
yearn I-KP
for I-KP
a I-KP
permanence I-KP
which I-KP
only I-KP
God I-KP
can I-KP
provide I-KP
by B-KP
taking I-KP
them I-KP
into I-KP
God I-KP
's I-KP
self I-KP
, I-KP
thereafter I-KP
changing I-KP
God I-KP
and I-KP
affecting I-KP
the I-KP
rest I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
universe I-KP
throughout I-KP
time I-KP
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
he O
sees O
God O
as O
permanent O
but O
as O
deficient B-KP
in I-KP
actuality I-KP
and I-KP
change I-KP
: O
alone O
, O
God O
is O
merely B-KP
eternally I-KP
unrealized I-KP
possibilities I-KP
, O
and O
requires O
the O
world O
to O
actualize O
them O
. O

God O
gives O
creatures O
permanence O
, O
while O
the O
creatures O
give O
God O
actuality O
and O
change O
. O

Here O
it O
is O
worthwhile O
to O
quote O
Whitehead O
at O
length O
: O

For O
Whitehead O
the O
core O
of O
religion O
was O
individual B-KP
. O

While O
he O
acknowledged O
that O
individuals O
can O
not O
ever O
be O
fully O
separated O
from O
their O
society O
, O
he O
argued O
that O
life O
is O
an O
internal O
fact O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
before O
it O
is O
an O
external O
fact O
relating O
to O
others O
. O

His O
most O
famous O
remark O
on O
religion O
is O
that O
`` O
religion O
is O
what O
the O
individual O
does O
with O
his O
own O
solitariness O
... O
and O
if O
you O
are O
never O
solitary O
, O
you O
are O
never O
religious O
. O
'' O

Whitehead O
saw O
religion O
as O
a B-KP
system I-KP
of I-KP
general I-KP
truths I-KP
that I-KP
transformed I-KP
a I-KP
person I-KP
's I-KP
character I-KP
. O

He O
took O
special O
care O
to O
note O
that O
while B-KP
religion I-KP
is I-KP
often I-KP
a I-KP
good I-KP
influence I-KP
, I-KP
it I-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
necessarily I-KP
good I-KP
an O
idea O
which O
he O
called O
a O
`` O
dangerous O
delusion O
'' O
( O
e.g. O
, O
a O
religion O
might O
encourage O
the O
violent O
extermination O
of O
a O
rival O
religion O
's O
adherents O
) O
. O

However O
, O
while O
Whitehead O
saw O
religion O
as O
beginning O
in O
solitariness B-KP
, O
he O
also O
saw O
religion O
as O
necessarily O
expanding O
beyond O
the O
individual O
. O

In O
keeping O
with O
his O
process O
metaphysics O
in O
which O
relations O
are O
primary O
, O
he O
wrote O
that O
religion O
necessitates O
the O
realization O
of O
`` O
the O
value O
of O
the O
objective O
world O
which O
is O
a O
community O
derivative O
from O
the O
interrelations O
of O
its O
component O
individuals O
. O
'' O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
universe O
is O
a O
community O
which O
makes O
itself O
whole O
through O
the O
relatedness O
of O
each O
individual O
entity O
to O
all O
the O
others O
meaning B-KP
and I-KP
value I-KP
do I-KP
not I-KP
exist I-KP
for I-KP
the I-KP
individual I-KP
alone I-KP
, I-KP
but I-KP
only I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
context I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
universal I-KP
community I-KP
. O

Whitehead O
writes O
further O
that O
each O
entity O
`` O
can O
find O
no O
such O
value O
till O
it O
has O
merged O
its O
individual O
claim O
with O
that O
of O
the O
objective O
universe O
. O

Religion O
is O
world O
loyalty O
. O

The B-KP
spirit I-KP
at I-KP
once I-KP
surrenders I-KP
itself I-KP
to I-KP
this I-KP
universal I-KP
claim I-KP
and I-KP
appropriates I-KP
it I-KP
for I-KP
itself I-KP
. O
'' O

In O
this O
way O
the B-KP
individual I-KP
and I-KP
universal/social I-KP
aspects I-KP
of I-KP
religion I-KP
are I-KP
mutually I-KP
dependent I-KP
. O

Overall O
, O
however O
, O
Whitehead O
's O
influence O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
characterize O
. O

In O
English O
speaking O
countries O
, O
his O
primary O
works O
are O
little O
studied O
outside O
of O
Claremont B-KP
and I-KP
a I-KP
select I-KP
number I-KP
of I-KP
liberal I-KP
graduate I-KP
level I-KP
theology I-KP
and I-KP
philosophy I-KP
programs I-KP
. O

Outside O
of O
these O
circles O
his O
influence O
is O
relatively O
small O
and O
diffuse O
, O
and O
has O
tended O
to O
come O
chiefly O
through B-KP
the I-KP
work I-KP
of I-KP
his I-KP
students I-KP
and I-KP
admirers I-KP
rather I-KP
than O
Whitehead O
himself O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Whitehead O
was O

The O
most O

in O

as O
Whitehead O

teaching O

in O
1925 O
, O
and O
is O
widely O
credited O
with O
developing B-KP
Whitehead I-KP

into I-KP
a I-KP

Process O

typically O
stresses O
God B-KP

nature I-KP

Rather O
than O
seeing O
God O
as O
impassive O
or O
emotionless O
, O
process O
theologians O
view O
God O
as O
`` O
the O

, O
and O
as O
the O

who O
is O
supremely O
affected O
by O

. O

Hartshorne O
points O
out O
that O
people B-KP
would I-KP
not I-KP
praise I-KP
a I-KP
human I-KP
ruler I-KP
who I-KP
was I-KP
unaffected I-KP
by I-KP
either I-KP
the I-KP
joys I-KP
or I-KP

so I-KP
why I-KP
would I-KP
this I-KP
be I-KP
a I-KP
praise I-KP
worthy I-KP
quality I-KP
in I-KP
God I-KP
? I-KP

Instead O
, O
as B-KP
the I-KP

who I-KP

most I-KP

, I-KP
God I-KP

can I-KP
most I-KP
appropriately I-KP
respond I-KP
to I-KP

In O
fact O
, O
process O

difficult O

Stout O
and O
Staton O
see O
both O
Whitehead O

as O
sharing O
an O
ontology B-KP
that I-KP
`` I-KP

a B-KP
conflict I-KP
of I-KP

between O
professional O

their O

combined O
with O
a O

Professional B-KP

managers I-KP
generally O
are O
compensated O

on O
the O
volume O

an O

to B-KP
maximize I-KP
their I-KP

As O
the O

in O
global O
investment O
capital O
caused O
the O
yields O
on O

, O
asset O

the O

not O

returning O

This O

a O
`` O
plausible B-KP

'' O
of O
the O
risks O
associated O
with O

because O
the O

Before O

was O
the O

which O
the O

IndyMac O
concluded O

This O
matters O
for O

A O

is O
very O
unlikely O
to O

They O
will O

While O
many O

would O
be O

even O
if O

suggested O
that O
if O
the O

an O

could O
occur O
. O

The O

According O
to O
the O
research O
by O
the O

be O
attributed O
to O

This O

The O
greatest O

As O

it O
was O

that O

as O
some O

went O
so O
far O

to O
advocate O
that O

`` O
needs O
to O
create O
a B-KP

bubble I-KP
to O
replace O
the O
Nasdaq O
bubble O
'' O
. O

Moreover O
, O
empirical O
studies O
using O
data O
from O
advanced O
countries O
show O
that O
excessive B-KP
credit I-KP
growth I-KP
contributed O
greatly O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
crisis O
. O

Bernanke O
explained O
that O
between O
1996 O
and O
2004 O
, O
the O
U.S. O
current O
account O
deficit O
increased O
by O
$ B-KP
650 I-KP
billion I-KP
, O
from O
1.5 O
% O
to O
5.8 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
GDP O
. O

Financing O
these O
deficits O
required O
the O
country O
to O
borrow O
large O
sums O
from O
abroad O
, O
much O
of O
it O
from O
countries O
running O
trade O
surpluses O
. O

These O
were O
mainly O
the O
emerging O
economies O
in O
Asia B-KP
and I-KP
oil I-KP
exporting I-KP
nations I-KP
. O

The O
balance O
of O
payments O
identity O
requires O
that O
a O
country O
( O
such O
as O
the O
U.S. O
) O
running O
a O
current O
account O
deficit O
also O
have O
a O
capital B-KP
account I-KP
( O
investment O
) O
surplus O
of O
the O

amount O
. O

Hence O
large O
and O
growing O
amounts O
of O
foreign B-KP
funds I-KP
( O
capital O
) O
flowed O
into O
the O
U.S. O
to O
finance O
its O
imports O
. O

The O
Fed O
then O
raised B-KP
the I-KP
Fed I-KP
funds I-KP
rate I-KP
significantly O
between O
July B-KP
2004 I-KP
and O
July O
2006 O
. O

This O
contributed O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
1 O
year O
and O
5 O
year O
adjustable B-KP
rate I-KP
mortgage I-KP
( O
ARM O
) O
rates O
, O
making O

interest O
rate O

. O

This O
may O
have O
also O
contributed O
to O
the O
deflating O
of O
the O
housing O
bubble O
, O
as O
asset O
prices O
generally O
move O
inversely B-KP
to O
interest O
rates O
, O
and O
it O
became O
riskier O

revealed O
that O

The O

additionally O
showed O
that O

did O
not O
meet O
the O
minimal O

Clayton O

analysis O
further O
showed O
that O
39 O

those O

were O
subsequently O
securitized O

Predatory B-KP
lending I-KP
refers O
to O
the O
practice O
of O
unscrupulous O
lenders O
, O
enticing O
borrowers O
to O
enter O
into O
`` O

A O
classic B-KP

method O
was O
used O
by O
Countrywide B-KP
Financial I-KP
, O
advertising O
low O

. O

Such O
loans O
were O
written O
into O

contracts O
, O
and O
swapped O
for O
more O
expensive O
loan O
products O
on O
the O
day O

Whereas O
the O
advertisement O
might O
state O
that O
1 O
% O
or O
1.5 O

would O
be O
charged O
, O
the O

would O

which O
the O
interest O
charged O
would O
be O
greater O
than O
the O
amount O

. O

This O
created O
negative B-KP

, O
which O
the O

might O
not O
notice O
until O
long O
after O
the O

Countrywide O

When O

This O
caused O

Critics O
such O
as O
economist O
Paul B-KP
Krugman I-KP
and O
U.S. O
Treasury O
Secretary O
Timothy B-KP
Geithner I-KP
have O
argued O
that O
the O
regulatory B-KP
framework I-KP
did O
not O
keep O
pace O
with O
financial O
innovation O
, O
such O
as O
the O
increasing O
importance O
of O
the O
shadow O
banking O
system O
, O
derivatives O
and O
off O
balance O
sheet O
financing O
. O

A O
recent O
OECD B-KP
study O
suggest O
that O
bank O
regulation O
based O
on O
the O
Basel B-KP
accords O
encourage O
unconventional O
business O
practices O
and O
contributed O
to O
or O
even O
reinforced O
the O

In O
other O
cases O
, O
laws O
were O
changed O
or O
enforcement O
weakened O
in O
parts O

system O
. O

Key O
examples O
include O
: O

Prior O
to O
the O
crisis O
, O
financial O
institutions O
became B-KP
highly I-KP
leveraged I-KP
, O
increasing O
their O
appetite O
for O
risky O
investments O
and O
reducing O
their O
resilience O
in O
case O
of O
losses O
. O

Much O
of O
this O
leverage O
was O
achieved O
using O
complex B-KP
financial I-KP
instruments I-KP
such O
as O
off O
balance O
sheet O
securitization O
and O
derivatives O
, O
which O
made O
it O
difficult O
for O
creditors O
and O
regulators O
to O
monitor O
and O
try O
to O
reduce O
financial O
institution O
risk O
levels O
. O

These O
instruments O
also O
made O
it O
virtually O
impossible O
to O
reorganize O
financial O
institutions O
in O
bankruptcy B-KP
, O
and O
contributed O
to O
the O
need O
for O
government B-KP
bailouts O
. O

From O
2004 O
to O
2007 O
, O
the O
top O
five B-KP

each O
significantly O
increased O
their O
financial O
leverage O
( O

, O
which O
increased O
their O
vulnerability O
to O
a O
financial B-KP
shock I-KP
. O

Changes O
in O
capital B-KP
requirements I-KP
, O
intended O
to O
keep O
U.S. O
banks O
competitive O
with O
their O
European O
counterparts O
, O
allowed O
lower O

weightings O
for O
AAA O

. O

The O
shift O
from O
first O
loss O

to O
AAA O
tranches O
was O
seen O
by O

as O
a O
risk O

Economist O
Hyman B-KP
Minsky I-KP
also O
described O
a O
`` O
paradox O
of O
deleveraging O
'' O
as O
financial O
institutions O
that O
have O
too O
much O
leverage O

During O
April O
2009 O
, O
U.S. O
Federal O
Reserve O
vice O
chair O
Janet B-KP
Yellen I-KP
discussed O
these O
paradoxes O
: O
`` O
Once O
this O

it O

take O

in I-KP
a I-KP

. O

The O
recession B-KP
, O
in O
turn O
, O
deepened O
the O
credit O
crunch O
as O
demand O
and O
employment O
fell O
, O
and O
credit O
losses O
of O

institutions O
surged O
. O

Indeed O
, O
we O
have O
been O
in O
the O
grips O
of O
precisely O
this O
adverse O
feedback O
loop O
for O
more O
than O
a O
year O
. O

A O
process O
of O
balance B-KP
sheet I-KP
deleveraging I-KP
has O
spread O
to O
nearly O
every O
corner O
of O
the O
economy O
. O

Consumers O
are O
pulling O
back O
on O
purchases O
, O
especially O
on O
durable O
goods O
, O
to O
build O
their O

. O

Businesses O
are O
cancelling B-KP
planned I-KP
investments I-KP
and O
laying O
off O
workers O

preserve O
cash O

And O
, O
financial O
institutions O
are O
shrinking O
assets O
to O
bolster O
capital O
and O
improve O
their O
chances O
of O
weathering O
the O
current O
storm O
. O

Once O
again O
, O
Minsky O
understood O
this O
dynamic O
. O

He O
spoke O
of O
the O
paradox O
of O
deleveraging O
, O
in O
which O
precautions O
that O
may O
be O
smart O
for O

essential O

The O
term O
financial B-KP
innovation I-KP
refers O
to O
the O
ongoing O
development O
of O
financial O
products O
designed O
to O
achieve O
particular O
client O
objectives O
, O
such O
as O
offsetting O
a O
particular O

exposure O
( O
such O
as O
the O

) O
or O
to O
assist O

Examples O
pertinent O
to O
this O
crisis O
included O
: O
the O
adjustable B-KP
rate I-KP

; O
the O
bundling O
of O

and O
a O
form O
of O

( O
CDS B-KP

The O
usage O
of O
these O

expanded B-KP
dramatically I-KP
in O
the O
years O

up O
to O
the O
crisis O

These O

vary O
in O

the O
ease O
with O
which O
they O
can O
be O
valued O
on O
the O
books O
of O
financial O

CDO O
issuance O
grew O
from O
an O
estimated O
$ B-KP
20 I-KP
billion I-KP
in O
Q1 O
2004 O
to O
its O
peak O
of O
over B-KP

Further O
, O
the O
credit O
quality O
of O
CDO O

declined O
from O
2000 O
to O
2007 O
, O
as O
the O
level O
of O
subprime O

increased O
from O

As O
described O
in O
the O
section O
on O
subprime O
lending O
, O
the O
CDS O
and O
portfolio O
of O
CDS O
called O
synthetic O
CDO O
enabled O
a O
theoretically O
infinite O
amount O
to O
be O
wagered O
on O
the O
finite O
value O
of O

loans O
outstanding O
, O
provided O
that O
buyers O
and O
sellers O
of O
the O

could O
be O
found O
. O

For O
example O
, O
buying O
a O
CDS O
to O
insure O
a O
CDO O
ended O
up O
giving O
the O
seller O
the O
same O
risk O
as O
if O
they O
owned O
the O
CDO O
, O
when O
those O
CDO O

became O
worthless O

This O
boom O
in O
innovative B-KP
financial I-KP
products I-KP
went O
hand O
in O
hand O
with O
more O
complexity O
. O

It O
multiplied B-KP
the I-KP
number I-KP
of I-KP
actors I-KP
connected I-KP
to O
a O
single O
mortgage O
( O
including O

With O
increasing O
distance O
from O
the O

these O
actors O
relied O
more O

more O
on O
indirect B-KP
information I-KP

the O
computer B-KP

agencies I-KP
and O

. O

Instead O

risk O
this O
provided O
the O
ground O
for O
fraudulent O
acts O

misjudgments O
and O
finally O
market O
collapse O

In O
2005 B-KP
a O
group O

built O
a O

The O
pricing B-KP
of I-KP
risk I-KP
refers O
to O
the O
incremental O
compensation O
required O
by O
investors O
for O

on O
additional O
risk O
, O
which O
may O
be O
measured O
by O
interest B-KP
rates I-KP
or I-KP
fees I-KP

Several O
scholars O
have O
argued O
that O
a O
lack B-KP
of I-KP
transparency I-KP
about I-KP
banks I-KP
' I-KP
risk I-KP
exposures I-KP
prevented O
markets O
from O
correctly O
pricing O
risk O
before O
the O
crisis O
, O
enabled O
the O
mortgage O
market O
to O
grow O
larger O
than O
it O
otherwise O
would O
have O
, O
and O
made O
the O
financial O
crisis O
far B-KP
more I-KP
disruptive I-KP
than O
it O
would O
have O
been O
if O
risk O
levels O
had O
been O
disclosed O
in O
a O
straightforward B-KP
, I-KP
readily I-KP
understandable I-KP
format I-KP
. O

For O
a B-KP
variety I-KP
of I-KP
reasons I-KP
, O
market O
participants O
did O
not O
accurately O
measure O
the O
risk B-KP
inherent I-KP
with I-KP
financial I-KP
innovation I-KP
such O
as O
MBS O
and O
CDOs O
or O
understand O
its O
impact O
on O
the O
overall O
stability O
of O
the O
financial O
system O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
pricing O
model O
for O
CDOs O
clearly O
did O
not O
reflect O
the O
level O
of O
risk O
they O
introduced O
into O
the O
system O
. O

Banks O
estimated O
that O
$ B-KP
450bn I-KP
of O
CDO O
were O
sold O
between O
`` O
late O
2005 O
to O
the O
middle O
of O
2007 O
'' O
; O
among O
the O
$ O
102bn O
of O
those O
that O
had O
been O
liquidated O
, O
JPMorgan O
estimated O
that O
the O
average O
recovery O
rate O
for O
`` O
high O
quality O
'' O
CDOs O
was O
approximately B-KP
32 I-KP
cents I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
dollar I-KP
, O
while O
the O
recovery O
rate O
for O
mezzanine O
CDO O
was O
approximately B-KP
five I-KP
cents I-KP
for I-KP
every I-KP
dollar I-KP
. O

Another O
example O
relates O
to O
AIG B-KP
, O
which O
insured O
obligations O
of O
various O
financial O
institutions O
through O
the O
usage O
of O
credit B-KP
default I-KP
swaps I-KP
. O

The O
basic O
CDS O
transaction O
involved O
AIG O
receiving O
a B-KP
premium I-KP
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
promise O
to O
pay O
money O
to O
party O
A O
in O
the O
event O
party O
B O
defaulted O
. O

However O
, O
AIG O
did O
not O
have O
the O
financial O
strength O
to O
support O
its O
many O
CDS O
commitments O
as O
the O
crisis O
progressed O
and O
was O
taken O
over O
by O
the O
government O
in O
September B-KP
2008 I-KP
. O

U.S. O
taxpayers O
provided O
over B-KP
$ I-KP
180 I-KP
billion I-KP
in O
government O
support O
to O
AIG O
during O
2008 O
and O
early O
2009 O
, O
through O
which O
the O
money O
flowed O
to O
various O
counterparties O
to O
CDS O
transactions O
, O
including O
many O
large O
global O
financial O
institutions O
. O

As O
financial O
assets O
became O
more O
and O
more B-KP
complex I-KP
, O
and O
harder O
and O
harder O
to O
value O
, O
investors O
were O
reassured O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
the O
international B-KP
bond I-KP
rating I-KP
agencies I-KP
and O
bank O
regulators O
, O
who O
came O
to O
rely O
on O
them O
, O
accepted O
as O
valid O
some O
complex O
mathematical O
models O
which O
theoretically O
showed O
the O
risks O
were O
much O
smaller O
than O
they O
actually O
proved O
to O
be O
. O

George B-KP
Soros I-KP
commented O
that O
`` O
The O
super O
boom O
got O
out O

when O
the O

so O
complicated O

authorities O
could O
no O
longer O
calculate O
the O
risks O
and O
started O
relying O
on O
the O
risk O
management O
methods O
of O
the B-KP

themselves O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
rating O
agencies O
relied O
on O
the O
information O
provided O
by O
the B-KP

placed O

`` O

also O
called O
the O

These O
entities O
became O
critical O
to O
the O
credit O
markets O
underpinning O
the O
financial O
system O
, O
but O
were O
not O
subject O
to O
the O

Further O
, O
these O

were O
vulnerable O
because O
of O
maturity B-KP
mismatch I-KP
, O
meaning O
that O
they O
borrowed O
short O

in O
liquid O

purchase O

, O
illiquid O
and O
risky O

. O

This O
meant O
that O

the O

these O

: O

The O

According O
to O
the O

the O

does O
not O
have O
the O
capital O
to O
close O
this O

as O

Feminist O

Ailsa B-KP

argue O
that O
the O

the O

revealed O
a O
crisis O
of O
ideas O
in O
mainstream B-KP

They O
argue O
that O
such O
a O

should O
include O
new O
advances O
within O
feminist B-KP

Current O
Governor O

Raghuram B-KP

2005 B-KP
when O
he O
became O

economist O
at O

International O

2005 O
, O
at B-KP
a I-KP

honouring I-KP
Alan I-KP

, O
who O
was O
about O
to O
retire O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
US O
Federal O

, O
Rajan O
delivered O
a O
controversial O
paper O
that O
was O
critical O
of O
the O
financial O
sector O
. O

In O
that O
paper O
, O
`` O

`` O
, O
Rajan O
`` O
argued O
that O

'' O

Rajan O
argued O
that O

were O
encouraged O
to O
`` O
take O
risks O
that O
generate O
severe O
adverse O
consequences O
with O

probability O

, O
in O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
time O
. O

These O
risks O
are O
known O
as O
tail B-KP
risks I-KP
. O

But O
perhaps O
the O
most O
important O
concern O
is O
whether O
banks O
will O
be O
able O
to O
provide O
liquidity O
to O
financial O
markets O
so O
that O
if O
the O
tail O
risk O
does O
materialise O
, O
financial O
positions O
can O
be O
unwound O
and O
losses O
allocated O
so O
that O
the O
consequences O
to O
the O
real O
economy O
are O
minimised O
. O
'' O

The O
financial O
crisis O
was O
not O
widely O

an O

United O

President O

key O

introduced O
a B-KP
series I-KP

In O
January O
2010 O
, O
Obama O
proposed O
additional O
regulations O
limiting O
the O
ability O
of O
banks O
to O
engage O
in O
proprietary B-KP

. O

The O
proposals O
were O
dubbed O
`` O
The O
Volcker O
Rule O
'' O
, O
in O
recognition O
of O
Paul B-KP
Volcker I-KP
, O
who O
has O
publicly O
argued O
for O
the O
proposed O
changes O
. O

The O
U.S. O
Senate O
passed O
a O
reform O
bill O
in O
May B-KP
2010 I-KP
, O
following O
the O
House O
which O
passed O
a O
bill O
in O
December B-KP
2009 I-KP
. O

These O
bills O
must O
now O
be O
reconciled O

The O
New O

provided O
a O
comparative O
summary O
of O
the O

of O
the O
two O
bills O
, O
which O
address O
to O
varying O
extent O
the O
principles O
enumerated O
by O
the O
Obama O
administration O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
the O
Volcker B-KP
Rule I-KP
against O
proprietary O
trading O
is O
not O
part O
of O
the O
legislation O
, O
though O
in O
the O
Senate B-KP
bill O
regulators O
have O
the O
discretion O
but O
not O
the O
obligation O
to O
prohibit O
these O
trades O
. O

It O
threatened O
the O
collapse O
of O
large O
financial O
institutions O
, O
which O
was O
prevented O
by O
the O
bailout B-KP
of I-KP

by O
national O

, O
but O
stock O

still O
dropped O
worldwide O

In O
many O

the O

Research O
into O
the O

of O
the O

the O

As O
part O
of O
the O

booms O
, O
the O
number O
of O

securities I-KP
( O
MBS O
) O
and O
collateralized B-KP
debt I-KP
obligations I-KP
( O

, O
which O
derived O
their O
value O
from O
mortgage B-KP
payments I-KP
and I-KP
housing I-KP
prices I-KP
, O
greatly O
increased O
. O

Such O
financial O
innovation O
enabled O
institutions B-KP
and I-KP
investors I-KP
around I-KP
the I-KP
world I-KP
to O
invest O
in O
the O
U.S. O
housing O

As O

that O
had O
borrowed O
and O
invested O
heavily O
in O

significant O
losses O
. O

Falling O
prices O
also O
resulted O
in O
homes O
worth O
less O

the O

providing O
a O

strength O
of O

Defaults O
and O
losses O
on O
other B-KP

types I-KP
also O
increased O
significantly O
as O
the O

expanded O
from O
the O

globally O
. O

While O
the O
housing O
and O
credit O
bubbles O
were O
building O
, O
a O
series O
of O
factors O
caused O
the O
financial O
system O
to O
both O
expand O

become O
increasingly O
fragile O
, O
a O
process O
called O
financialization B-KP
. O

U.S. B-KP
Government I-KP
policy I-KP
from O
the O
1970s O
onward O
has O
emphasized O
deregulation B-KP
to O
encourage O
business O

which O
resulted O
in O
less O

less O
disclosure O

about O
new O

undertaken O
by O

Thus O
, O
policymakers O
did O
not O
immediately O
recognize O
the O

played O
by O
financial O
institutions O
such O
as O
investment B-KP
banks I-KP

hedge I-KP
funds I-KP
, O
also O
known O
as O
the O
shadow O
banking O
system O

Some O
experts O
believe O
these O
institutions O
had O
become O
as O
important O
as O
commercial O
( O
depository O
) O
banks O
in O
providing O
credit O
to O
the O
U.S. O
economy O
, O
but O
they O
were O
not O
subject O
to O
the O
same O
regulations O
. O

These O
institutions O
, O
as O
well O
as O
certain O
regulated O
banks O
, O
had O
also O
assumed O
significant O
debt O
burdens O
while O
providing O
the O
loans O
described O
above O
and O
did O
not O
have O
a O
financial O
cushion O
sufficient O
to O
absorb O
large B-KP
loan I-KP
defaults I-KP
or I-KP
MBS I-KP
losses I-KP
. O

These O
losses O
impacted O
the O
ability O
of O
financial O
institutions O
to O
lend O
, O
slowing B-KP
economic I-KP
activity I-KP
. O

Concerns O
regarding O
the O
stability O
of O
key O
financial O
institutions O
drove O
central B-KP
banks I-KP
to O
provide O
funds O
to O
encourage O
lending O
and O
restore O
faith O
in O
the O
commercial O
paper O
markets O
, O
which O
are O
integral O
to O
funding O
business O
operations O
. O

Governments B-KP
also O
bailed O
out O
key O
financial O
institutions O
and O
implemented O
economic O
stimulus O
programs O
, O
assuming O
significant O
additional O
financial O
commitments O

The O
U.S. O

reported O
its O
findings O

an O

that O

During O
a O
period O
of O
tough B-KP
competition I-KP
between O
mortgage O
lenders O
for O
revenue O
and O

, O
and O
when O
the O
supply O

, O
mortgage O
lenders O
relaxed O

and O
originated O
riskier O

In O
the O
view O
of O
some O

, O
the O
relatively O
conservative O

to O
2003 B-KP

However O
, O
as O
market O
power O
shifted O
from O
securitizers O

and O
as O
intense O
competition O
from O
private O
securitizers O
undermined O

power O
, O

this O
was O
an O
early O
warning O
to O
the O
systemic O
risk O
that O
the O
growing O
market O
in O
subprime O
mortgages O
posed O
to O
the O
U.S. O
financial O
system O
that O
went O
unheeded O

A O

United O

Department O
of O
the O
Treasury O
study O
of O
lending O
trends O
for O
305 O
cities O
from O
1993 O
to O
1998 O
showed O
that O
$ B-KP
467 I-KP
billion I-KP
of O
mortgage O
lending O
was O
made O
by O
Community B-KP
Reinvestment I-KP
Act I-KP
( O
CRA O
) O
covered O
lenders O
into O
low O
and O
mid O
level O
income O
( O
LMI O
) O
borrowers O
and O
neighborhoods O
, O
representing O
10 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
all O
U.S. O
mortgage O
lending O
during O
the O
period O
. O

The O
majority O
of O
these O
were O
prime O
loans O
. O

Sub O
prime O
loans O
made O
by O
CRA O
covered O
institutions O
constituted O
a O
3 O
% O
market O
share O
of O
LMI O
loans O
in O
1998 O
, O
but O
in O
the O
run O
up O
to O
the O
crisis O
, O
fully O
25 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
all O
sub O
prime O
lending O
occurred O
at O
CRA O
covered O
institutions O
and O
another O
25 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
sub O
prime O

had O
some O
connection O
with O
CRA O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
an O
analysis O
by O
the O
Federal O
Reserve O
Bank O
of O
Dallas O
in O
2009 O
, O
however O
, O
concluded O
that O
the O
CRA O
was O
not O
responsible O
for O
the O
mortgage O
loan O
crisis O
, O
pointing O
out O
that O
CRA O
rules O
have O
been O
in O
place O
since O
1995 O
whereas O
the O
poor O
lending O
emerged O
only O
a O
decade O
later O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
most O
sub O
prime O
loans O
were O
not O
made O
to O
the O
LMI O
borrowers O
targeted O
by O
the O
CRA O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
years O
2005 O
2006 O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
crisis O
. O

Nor O
did O
it O
find O
any O
evidence O
that O
lending O
under O
the O
CRA O
rules O
increased O
delinquency O
rates O
or O
that O
the O
CRA O
indirectly O
influenced O
independent O
mortgage O
lenders O
to O
ramp O
up O
sub O
prime O
lending O
. O

To O
other O
analysts O
the O
delay O
between O
CRA O
rule O
changes O
( O
in O
1995 O
) O
and O
the O
explosion O
of O
subprime O
lending O
is O
not O
surprising O
, O
and O
does O
not O
exonerate O
the O
CRA O
. O

They O
contend O
that O
there O
were O
two O
, O
connected O
causes O
to O
the O
crisis O
: O
the O
relaxation O
of O
underwriting O
standards O
in O
1995 B-KP
and O
the O
ultra O
low O
interest O
rates O
initiated O
by O
the O
Federal O
Reserve O
after B-KP
the I-KP
terrorist I-KP
attack I-KP
on I-KP
September I-KP
11 I-KP
, I-KP
2001 I-KP
. O

Both O
causes O
had O
to O
be O
in O
place O
before O
the O
crisis O
could O
take O
place O
. O

Critics O
also O
point O
out O
that O
publicly O
announced O
CRA O
loan O
commitments O
were O
massive O
, O
totaling O
$ B-KP
4.5 I-KP
trillion I-KP
in O
the O
years O
between O
1994 O
and O
2007 O
. O

They O
also O
argue O
that O
the O
Federal O
Reserve O
s O
classification O
of O
CRA O
loans O
as O
prime B-KP
is O
based O
on O
the O
faulty O
and O
self O
serving O
assumption O
that O
high B-KP
interest I-KP
rate I-KP
loans I-KP
( I-KP
3 I-KP
percentage I-KP
points I-KP
over I-KP
average I-KP
) I-KP
equal O
subprime O
loans O
. O

Others O
have O
pointed O
out O
that O
there O
were O
not O
enough O
of O
these O
loans O
made O
to O
cause O
a O
crisis O
of O
this O
magnitude O
. O

By O

When O
talking O

should O
distinguish O
between O
prokaryotes B-KP

eukaryotes I-KP
as O
the O
big O
differences O
on O
contents O

they O
have O
. O

In O
prokaryotes O
, O
most O
of O
the O
genome O
( O
85 O
90 O

is O
non O
repetitive O

which O
means O
coding O
DNA O
mainly O
forms O
it O

while O
non O
coding O
regions O
only O
take O
a O
small O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
eukaryotes O
have O
the O
feature O
of O

organization O
of O
protein O
coding O
genes O
; O
the O
variation O
of O
repetitive O
DNA O
content O
in O
eukaryotes O
is O
also O
extremely O
high O
. O

In O
mammals B-KP

plants I-KP
, O
the O
major O
part O
of O
the O
genome O
is O
composed O
of O
repetitive O

. O

Most O
biological O
entities O
that O
are O
more O
complex O
than O
a O
virus B-KP
sometimes O
or O
always O
carry O
additional O
genetic O
material O
besides O
that O
which O
resides O
in O
their O

In O
some O
contexts O
, O
such O
as O
sequencing O
the O
genome O
of O
a O
pathogenic B-KP
microbe I-KP
, O
`` O

is O
meant O
to O
include O
information O
stored O
on O
this O
auxiliary O
material O
, O
which O
is O
carried O
in O
plasmids B-KP
. O

In O
such O
circumstances O
then O
, O
`` O
genome O
'' O
describes O
all O
of O
the O
genes O

however O
, O
`` O

'' O
carries O
the O
typical O
connotation O
of O
only O
information O
on O
chromosomal O
DNA O
. O

So O
although O
these O
organisms O
contain O
chloroplasts O
or O
mitochondria O
that O
have O
their O
own O
DNA O
, O
the O
genetic O
information O
contained O
by O
DNA O
within O
these O
organelles O
is O
not O
considered O
part O
of O
the O
genome O

In O
fact O
, O
mitochondria O
are O
sometimes O
said O
to O
have O
their O
own O
genome O
often O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
`` O
mitochondrial B-KP

'' O
. O

The O
DNA O
found O
within O
the O
chloroplast O
may O
be O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
`` O
plastome B-KP
'' O
. O

Genome B-KP
size I-KP
is O
the O
total O
number O
of O
DNA O
base O
pairs O
in O
one O

of O
a O

The O
genome O

is O
positively O
correlated O
with O
the O
morphological B-KP

among O
prokaryotes O

lower O
eukaryotes O

however O
, O
after O
mollusks O
and O
all O
the O
other O
higher O

above O
, O
this O

is O
no O

the O
mighty O

on O
the O

Since O
genomes O
are O
very O
complex O
, O
one O
research O
strategy O
is O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O

a O

the O

The O

Protein B-KP

are O
generally O

In O

the O

which O
are O
then O
duplicated O

play O
a O
major O
role O
in O
shaping O
the O

Duplication O
may O
range O
from O
extension O
of O
short O
tandem O
repeats O

to O
duplication O
of O
a O
cluster O
of O

and O
all O
the O

to O
duplication O
of O
entire O

even O
entire O

Such O
duplications O
are O
probably O
fundamental O

the O
creation O

Horizontal B-KP
gene I-KP

A O

in O

where O

in O

Comprehensive O
schools O
are O
primarily O
about O
providing O
an O
entitlement O
curriculum O
to O
all O
children O
, O
without O
selection O
whether O
due O
to O
financial O
considerations O
or O

. O

A O
consequence O
of O
that O
is O
a O
wider O
ranging O
curriculum O
, O
including O
practical O
subjects O
such O
as O
design B-KP
and I-KP

which O
were O
less O

Providing O
post O
16 O
education O
cost O
effectively O
becomes O
more O
challenging O
for O
smaller O
comprehensive O
schools O
, O
because O
of O
the O
number O
of O
courses O
needed O
to O
cover O
a O
broader O
curriculum O
with O
comparatively O
fewer O
students O
. O

This O
is O
why O
schools O
have O
tended O
to O
get O
larger O
and O
also O
why O
many O
local O
authorities O
have O
organised O
secondary O
education O
into O
11 O

Comprehensive O
schools O
do O
not O
select O
their O
intake O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

, O
but O
there O
are O
demographic O
reasons O
why O
the O

profiles O

vary O
considerably O

In O

government O
initiatives O
such O
as O
the O
City B-KP

Specialist I-KP

have O
made O
the O
comprehensive O

less O
certain O
. O

In O
these O
schools O
children O
could O
be O
selected O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
curriculum O

to O
the O

even O
though O
the O
schools O
do O
take O
quotas O
from O
each O
quartile O
of O
the O
attainment O
range O
to O
ensure O
they O
were O
not O
selective O
by O

. O

A O
problem O
with O
this O
is O
whether O
the O
quotas O
should O
be O
taken O
from O
a O
normal O
distribution O
or O
from O
the O
specific O
distribution O
of O
attainment O
in O
the O
immediate O

In O
the O
selective O
school O
system O
, O
which O
survives O
in O
several O
parts O
of O
the O
United O

, O
admission O
is O
dependent O
on O
selection O
criteria O
, O
most O
commonly O
a O
cognitive O
test O
or O

Although O
comprehensive O

were O
introduced O

in O
1965 B-KP

Comprehensive O
schools O
were O
introduced O
into O
Ireland O
in O
1966 B-KP
by O
an O
initiative O
by O
Patrick B-KP
Hillery I-KP
, O
Minister O
for O
Education O
, O
to O
give O
a O
broader O
range O
of O
education O
compared O
to O
that O
of O
the O
vocational B-KP
school I-KP
system I-KP
, O
which O
was O
then O
the O
only O
system O
of O
schools O
completely O
controlled O
by O
the O
state O

Until O
then O
, O
education O
in O
Ireland O
was O
largely O
dominated O
by O
religious O
persuasion O
, O
particularly O
the O
voluntary O
secondary O
school O
system O
was O
a O
particular O
realisation O
of O
this O
. O

The O
comprehensive O
school O
system O
is O
still O
relatively O
small O
and O
to O
an O
extent O
has O
been O
superseded O
by O
the O
community B-KP
school I-KP
concept O
. O

The O
Irish O
word O
for O
a O
comprehensive O
school O
is O
a O
'scoil O
chuimsitheach O
. O
' O

In O
Ireland O
comprehensive O
schools O
were O
an O
earlier O
model O
of O
state O
schools O
, O
introduced O
in O
the O
late O
1960s O
and O
largely O
replaced O
by O
the O
secular O
community O
model O
of O
the O
1970s B-KP
. O

The O
comprehensive O
model O
generally O
incorporated O
older O
schools O
that O
were O
under O
Roman O
Catholic O
or O
Protestant O
ownership O
, O
and O
the O
various O
denominations O
still O
manage O
the O
school O
as O
patrons O
or O
trustees O
. O

The B-KP
state I-KP
owns O
the O
school O
property O
, O
which O
is O
vested O
in O
the O
trustees O
in O
perpetuity O
. O

The O
model O
was O
adopted O
to O
make O
state O
schools O
more O
acceptable O
to O
a O
largely O
conservative O
society O
of O
the O
time O
. O

The O
introduction O
of O
the O
community O
school O
model O
in O
the O
1970s O
controversially O
removed O
the B-KP
denominational I-KP
basis I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
schools I-KP
, O
but O
religious O
interests O
were O
invited O
to O
be O
represented O
on O
the O

Community B-KP

tended O
to O
be O
amalgamations O
of O
unviable O
local O
schools O
under O
the O
umbrella O
of O
a O
new O
community O
school O
model O
, O
but O
community O
schools O
have O
tended O
to O
be O
entirely O
new O

The O
first O
comprehensives O
were O
set O
up O
after O
the O
Second O
World O

In O

In O

Margaret B-KP
Thatcher I-KP
became O
Secretary O
of O

for O

of O
the O
new O
Conservative B-KP

She O
ended O
the O
compulsion O

however O
, O
many O

were O
so O
far O
down O
the O

that O
it O
would O
have O
been O
prohibitively O
expensive O
to O
attempt O

reverse O
the O

By O

the O
majority O

had O
abandoned O
the O

moved O

Over O
that O
10 O

many O
secondary O

a O

were O
built O

By O
the O
mid O
1970s O
the O
system O
had O
been O
almost O
fully O
implemented O
, O
with O
virtually O
no O

remaining O

Many O
grammar O

were O
either O

Some O
local O
authorities O

Sandwell B-KP

changed O

Since O

Act I-KP

The O
concept O

introduces O
the O
idea O

a O
fundamental O
change O
to O
the O
original O
`` O

is O
partly O
intended O
as O
a O
means O
by O
which O
schools O
that O
are O
perceived O
to O
be O
inferior O
are O
forced O
either O
to O

if O

Government O
policy O

tensions O
between O
the O

On O

, O
President O
Lissouba O
's O
government O
forces O
surrounded O
Sassou O
's O
compound O
in O
Brazzaville O
and O
Sassou O
ordered O
members O
of O
his O
private O
militia O
( O
known O
as O
`` O
Cobras B-KP

) O
to O
resist O
. O

Thus O
began O
a O
four O
month O
conflict O
that O
destroyed O
or O
damaged O
much O
of O
Brazzaville O

caused O
tens O

In O
early O
October B-KP

the O
Angolan B-KP

In O
mid O
October O
, O
the O
Lissouba O

fell O

Soon O

, O
Sassou O
declared O
himself O

In O
the O
controversial O

in O
2002 O
, O
Sassou O
won O
with O
almost O
90 O

His O
two O
main O

, O
Lissouba O

were O
prevented O
from O

the O
only O
remaining O

, O
Andre O
Milongo B-KP

advised O
his O

then O
withdrew O

A O

extended O
his O

and O
introduced O
a O

International O
observers O
took O
issue O
with O
the O

Congo O

In O

often O
in O

the O

selects O

and O
allocates O
posts O

members O
within O
the O

In O
most O
systems O
, O
the O
prime O

is O
the O
presiding O

In O
a O
minority O
of O
systems O
, O
notably O
in O
semi O
presidential O
systems O
of O
government O
, O
a O
prime O
minister O
is O
the O
official O
who O
is O
appointed O
to O
manage O
the O
civil B-KP
service I-KP
and O
execute O
the O
directives O
of O
the O
head O
of O
state O
. O

In O
parliamentary O
systems O
fashioned O
after O
the O
Westminster B-KP
system I-KP
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
is O
the O
presiding O
and O
actual O
head O
of O
government O
and O
head O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O

In O
such O

official O
representative O
( O
i.e O

the O
monarch O
, O
president O
, O
or O
governor O
general O
) O
usually O
holds O
a O
largely O
ceremonial B-KP
position O
, O
although O
often O
with O
reserve O
powers O
. O

The O
prime O
minister O
is O
often O
, O
but O
not O
always O
, O
a O
member O
of O
parliament B-KP
[ O
clarification O

] O
and O
is O
expected O
with O
other O
ministers O
to O
ensure B-KP
the I-KP
passage I-KP
of I-KP
bills I-KP
through O
the O
legislature O
. O

In O
some O
monarchies O
the O
monarch O
may O
also O
exercise O
executive O
powers O
( O
known O
as O
the O
royal B-KP
prerogative I-KP

that O
are O
constitutionally O
vested O
in O

and O
may O
be O

without O

As O
well O
as O
being O
head O
of O

, O
a O
prime O
minister O
may O
have O
other O
roles O

The O
first O
actual O
usage O
of O
the O
term O
prime O
minister O
or O
Premier O
Ministre O
[ O
citation O
needed O
] O
was O
used O
by O
Cardinal B-KP
Richelieu I-KP
when O
in O
1625 B-KP
he O
was O
named O
to O
head O
the O
royal O
council O
as O
prime O
minister O
of O
France B-KP
. O

Louis B-KP
XIV I-KP
and O
his O
descendants O
generally O
attempted O
to O
avoid O
giving O
this O
title O
to O
their O
chief O
ministers O
. O

The O
term O
prime O
minister O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
we O
know O
it O
originated O
in O
the O
18th B-KP
century I-KP
in O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
when O
members O
of O
parliament O
disparagingly O
used O
the O
title O
in O
reference O
to O
Sir B-KP
Robert I-KP
Walpole I-KP
. O

Over O
time O
, O
the O
title O
became O
honorific O
and O
remains O
so O
in O
the O
21st O
century O
. O

The O
monarchs O
of O
England O
and O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
had O
ministers O
in O
whom O
they O
placed O
special O
trust O
and O
who O
were O
regarded O
as O
the O
head O
of O
the O
government O
. O

Examples O
were O
Thomas B-KP
Cromwell I-KP
under O
Henry O
VIII O
; O
William O
Cecil O
, O
Lord O
Burghley O
under O
Elizabeth O
I O
; O
Clarendon B-KP
under O
Charles O
II O
and O
Godolphin B-KP
under O
Queen O
Anne O
. O

These O
ministers O
held O
a O
variety O
of O
formal O
posts O
, O
but O
were O
commonly O
known O
as O
`` O
the O
minister O
'' O
, O
the O
`` O
chief O
minister O
'' O
, O
the O
`` O
first O
minister O
'' O
and O
finally O
the O
`` O
prime O
minister O
'' O
. O

The O
power O
of O
these O
ministers O
depended O
entirely O
on O
the O
personal O
favour O
of O
the B-KP
monarch I-KP
. O

Although O
managing O
the O
parliament O
was O
among O
the O
necessary O
skills O
of O
holding O
high O
office O
, O
they O
did O
not O
depend O
on O
a O
parliamentary O
majority O
for O
their O
power O
. O

Although O
there O
was O
a O
cabinet O
, O
it O
was O
appointed O
entirely O
by O
the O
monarch O
, O
and O
the O
monarch O
usually O
presided O
over O
its O
meetings O
. O

When O
the O
monarch O
grew O
tired O
of O
a O
first O
minister O
, O
he O
or O
she O
could O
be O
dismissed O
, O
or O
worse O
: O
Cromwell O
was O
executed O
and O
Clarendon B-KP
driven O
into O
exile O
when O
they O
lost O
favour O
. O

Kings O
sometimes O
divided O
power O
equally O
between O
two O
or O
more O
ministers O
to O
prevent O
one O
minister O
from O
becoming O
too O
powerful O
. O

Late O
in O
Anne O
's O
reign O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
Tory O
ministers O
Harley B-KP
and I-KP
St I-KP
John I-KP
shared O
power O
. O

In O
the O
mid O
17th O
century O
, O
after O
the O
English O
Civil O
War O
( O
1642 O
1651 O
) O
, O
Parliament O
strengthened O
its O
position O
relative O
to O
the O
monarch O
then O
gained O
more O
power O
through O
the O
Glorious B-KP
Revolution I-KP
of O
1688 O
and O
passage O
of O
the O
Bill B-KP
of I-KP
Rights I-KP
in O
1689 O
. O

The O
monarch O
could O
no O
longer O
establish O
any O
law O
or O
impose O
any O
tax O
without O
its O
permission O
and O
thus O
the O
House B-KP
of I-KP
Commons I-KP
became O
a O
part O
of O
the O
government O
. O

It O
is O
at O
this O
point O
that O
a O
modern O
style O
of O
prime O
minister O
begins O
to O
emerge O
. O

A O
tipping O
point O
in O
the O
evolution O
of O
the O
prime O
ministership O
came O
with O
the O
death O
of O
Anne O
in O
1714 B-KP
and O
the O
accession O
of O
George B-KP
I I-KP
to O
the O
throne O
. O

George O
spoke O
no O
English O
, O
spent O
much O
of O
his O
time O
at O
his O
home O
in O
Hanover B-KP
, O
and O
had O
neither O
knowledge O
of O
, O
nor O
interest O
in O
, O
the O
details O
of O
English O
government O
. O

In O
these O
circumstances O
it O
was O
inevitable O
that O
the O
king O
's O
first O
minister O
would O
become O
the O
de O
facto O
head O
of O
the O
government O
. O

From O
1721 O
this O
was O
the O
Whig B-KP
politician O
Robert O
Walpole O
, O
who O
held O
office O
for O
twenty B-KP
one I-KP
years I-KP
. O

Walpole O
chaired O
cabinet O
meetings O
, O
appointed O
all O
the O
other O
ministers O
, O
dispensed O
the O
royal O
patronage O
and O
packed O
the O
House O
of O
Commons O
with O
his O
supporters O
. O

Under O
Walpole O
, O
the O
doctrine B-KP
of I-KP
cabinet I-KP
solidarity I-KP
developed O
. O

Walpole O
required O
that O
no O
minister O
other O
than O
himself O
have O
private O
dealings O
with O
the O
king O
, O
and O
also O
that O
when O
the O
cabinet O
had O
agreed O
on O
a O
policy O
, O
all O
ministers O
must O
defend O
it O
in O
public O
, O
or O
resign B-KP
. O

As O
a O
later O
prime O
minister O
, O
Lord B-KP
Melbourne I-KP
, O
said O
, O
`` O
It O
matters O
not O
what O
we O
say O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
so O
long O
as O
we O
all O
say O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
'' O

Walpole O
always O
denied O
that O
he O
was O
`` O
prime O
minister O
'' O
, O
and O
throughout O
the O
18th O
century O
parliamentarians B-KP
and I-KP
legal I-KP
scholars I-KP
continued O
to O
deny O
that O
any O
such O
position O
was O
known O
to O
the O
Constitution O
. O

George B-KP
II I-KP
and I-KP
George I-KP
III I-KP
made O
strenuous O
efforts O
to O
reclaim O
the O
personal O
power O
of O
the O
monarch O
, O
but O
the O
increasing O
complexity O
and O
expense O
of O
government O
meant O
that O
a O
minister O
who O
could O
command O
the O
loyalty O
of O
the O
Commons O
was O
increasingly O
necessary O
. O

The O
long O
tenure O
of O
the O
wartime O
prime O
minister O
William O
Pitt O
the O
Younger O
( O
1783 O
1801 O
) O
, O
combined O
with O
the O
mental O
illness O
of O
George O
III O
, O
consolidated O
the O
power O
of O
the O
post O
. O

The O
title O
was O
first O
referred O
to O
on O
government O
documents O
during O
the O
administration O
of O
Benjamin B-KP
Disraeli I-KP
but O
did O
not O
appear O
in O
the O
formal O
British O
Order O
of O
precedence O
until O
1905 B-KP
. O

By O
the O
late O
20th O
century O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
world O
's O
countries O
had O
a O
prime O
minister O
or O
equivalent O
minister O
, O
holding O
office O
under O
either O
a O
constitutional O
monarchy O
or O
a O
ceremonial O
president B-KP
. O

The O
main O
exceptions O
to O
this O
system O
have O
been O
the O
United O
States O
and O
the O
presidential O
republics O
in O
Latin O
America O
modelled O
on O
the O
U.S. O
system O

in O
which O
the O

directly O
exercises O
executive O
authority O

The O
post O

hybrid O
constitution O
( O
a O
constitution O
that O
is O
partly O
formally O
codified O
and O
partly O
uncodified O
) O
originally O
did O
not O
make O
any O
reference O
whatsoever O
to O
a O
prime O
minister O
, O
with O
her O
or O
his O
specific O
duties O
and O
method O
of O
appointment O
instead O
dictated O
by O

'' O

In O

Constitution I-KP
Act I-KP
, O
1982 B-KP
, O
passing O
reference O
to O
a O
`` O
Prime O
Minister O
of O
Canada O
'' O
is O
added O
, O
though O
only O
regarding O
the O
composition O
of O
conferences O
of O
federal B-KP
and I-KP
provincial I-KP
first I-KP
ministers I-KP
. O

Czech O
Republic O
's O
constitution B-KP
clearly O
outlines O
the O
functions O
and O
powers O
of O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
of O
the O
Czech O
Republic O
, O
and O
also O
details O
the O
process O
of O
his/her O
appointment O
and O
dismissal O
. O

The O
United O
Kingdom O
's O
constitution O
, O
being O
uncodified O
and O
largely O
unwritten O
, O
makes O
no O
mention O
of O
a O
prime O
minister O
. O

Though O
it O
had O
de O
facto O
existed O
for O
centuries O
, O
its O
first O
mention O
in O
official O
state O
documents O
did O
not O
occur O
until O
the O
first B-KP
decade I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
twentieth I-KP
century I-KP
. O

Accordingly O
, O
it O
is O
often O
said O
`` O
not O
to O
exist O
'' O
, O
indeed O
there O
are O
several O
instances O
of O
parliament O
declaring O
this O
to O
be O
the O
case O
. O

The O
prime O
minister O
sits O
in O
the O
cabinet O
solely O
by O
virtue O
of O
occupying O
another O
office O
, O
either O
First O
Lord O
of O
the O
Treasury O
( O
office O
in O
commission O
) O
, O
or O
more O
rarely O
Chancellor O
of O
the O
Exchequer O
( O
the O
last O
of O
whom O
was O
Balfour B-KP
in O
1905 B-KP
) O
. O

Most O
prime O
ministers O
in O
parliamentary O
systems O
are O
not O
appointed O
for O
a O
specific O
term O
in O
office O
and O
in O
effect O
may O
remain O
in O
power O
through O
a O
number O
of O
elections O
and O
parliaments O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Margaret B-KP
Thatcher I-KP
was O
only O
ever O
appointed O
prime O
minister O
on O
one O
occasion O
, O
in O
1979 B-KP
. O

She O
remained O
continuously O
in O
power O
until O
1990 B-KP
, O
though O
she O
used O
the O
assembly O
of O
each O
House O
of O
Commons O
after O
a O
general O
election O
to O
reshuffle O
her O
cabinet B-KP
. O

Some O
states O
, O
however O
, O
do O
have O
a O
term O
of O
office O
of O
the O
prime O
minister O
linked O
to O
the O
period O
in O
office O
of O
the O
parliament O
. O

Hence O
the O
Irish O
Taoiseach B-KP
is O
formally O
'renominated O
' O
after B-KP
every I-KP
general I-KP
election I-KP
. O

( O
Some O
constitutional O
experts O
have O
questioned O
whether O
this O
process O
is O
actually O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
Irish O
constitution O
, O
which O
appear O
to O
suggest O
that O
a O
taoiseach O
should O
remain O
in O
office O
, O
without O
the O
requirement O
of O
a O
renomination O
, O
unless O
s/he O
has O
clearly O
lost O
the O
general O
election O
. O
) O

The O
position O
of O
prime O
minister O
is O
normally O
chosen O
from O
the B-KP
political I-KP
party I-KP
that I-KP
commands I-KP
majority I-KP
of I-KP
seats I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
lower I-KP
house I-KP
of I-KP
parliament I-KP
. O

In O
parliamentary O
systems O
, O
governments O
are O
generally O
required O
to O
have O
the O
confidence O
of O
the O
lower B-KP
house I-KP
of I-KP
parliament I-KP
( O
though O
a O
small O
minority O
of O
parliaments O
, O
by O
giving O
a O
right O
to O
block O
supply O
to O
upper B-KP
houses I-KP
, O
in O
effect O
make O
the O
cabinet O
responsible O
to O
both O
houses O
, O
though O
in O
reality O
upper O
houses O
, O
even O
when O
they O
have O
the O
power O
, O
rarely O
exercise O
it O
) O
. O

Where O
they O
lose O
a O
vote B-KP
of I-KP
confidence I-KP
, O
have O
a O
motion O
of O
no O
confidence O
passed O
against O
them O
, O
or O
where O
they O
lose O
supply O
, O
most O
constitutional O
systems O
require O
either O
: O

The O
latter O
in O
effect O
allows O
the O
government O
to O
appeal O
the O
opposition O
of O
parliament O
to O
the O
electorate O
. O

However O
, O
in O
many O
jurisdictions O
a O
head B-KP
of I-KP
state I-KP
may O
refuse O
a O
parliamentary O
dissolution O
, O
requiring O
the O
resignation B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
prime B-KP
minister I-KP
and I-KP
his I-KP
or I-KP
her I-KP
government I-KP
. O

In O
most O
modern O
parliamentary O
systems O
, O
the O
prime O
minister O
is O
the O
person O
who O
decides O
when O
to O
request O
a O
parliamentary O
dissolution O
. O

Older O
constitutions O
often O
vest O
this O
power O
in O
the O
cabinet B-KP
. O

In O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
tradition O
whereby O
it O
is O
the O
prime O
minister O
who O
requests O
a O
dissolution O
of O
parliament O
dates O
back O
to O
1918 B-KP
. O

Prior O
to O
then O
, O
it O
was O
the O
entire O
government O
that O
made O
the O
request O
. O

Similarly O
, O
though O
the O
modern O
1937 B-KP
Irish O
constitution O
grants O
to O
the O
Taoiseach O
the O
right O
to O
make O
the O
request O
, O
the O
earlier O
1922 O
Irish O
Free O
State O
Constitution O
vested O
the O
power O
in O
the B-KP
Executive I-KP
Council I-KP
( O
the O
then O
name O
for O
the O
Irish O
cabinet O
) O
. O

In O
Australia O
, O
the O
Prime O
Minister O
is O
expected O
to O
step O
down O
if O

loses O
the O

support O
of O
his/her O
party O
under O
a O
spill B-KP
motion I-KP

many O
such O

In O
the O

the O
prime O

is O
actually O
titled O

may O
also O
be O

A O
number O
of O
polytechnics O
providing O
higher O

is O
simply O
a O
result O
of O
a O
formal O
upgrading O
from O
their O
original O
and O
historical O
role O
as O
intermediate O
technical O

. O

In O
some O
situations O
, O
former O
polytechnics O
or O
other O
non O

institutions O
have O
emerged O
solely O
through O
an O
administrative O
change O
of O
statutes O
, O
which O
often O
included O
a O
name O
change O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O

, O

, O

, O
or O

purposes O

Such O
emergence O
of O
so O
many O
upgraded O
polytechnics O
, O
former O
vocational O
education O
and O
technical O
schools O
converted O
into O
more O
university O
like O
institutions O
has O
caused O
concern O
where O
the O
lack O
of O
specialized O
intermediate O
technical O
professionals O
lead O
to O
industrial O
skill O
shortages O
in O
some O
fields O
, O
being O
also O
associated O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
the O
graduate O
unemployment O
rate O
. O

This O
is O
mostly O
the O
case O
in O
those O
countries O
, O
where O
the O
education O
system O
is O
not O
controlled O
by O
the O

everybody O
can O

decline O
in O
the O

due O

( O

argues O
that O
all O
the O
tools O
are O
in O
place O
to O
promote O
the O
debate O
on O
the O
place O
of O

in O

in O
general O
and O
in O
Universities O
of O
Technology O
specifically O
. O

The O
aspects O
of O
this O
debate O
can O
follow O
the O
following O
lines O
: O
To O
what O
degree O
is O
technology O
defined O
as O
a O
concept O
? O

What O
is O
the O
scope O
of O
technology O
discourse O
? O

What O
is O
the O
place O
and O
relation O
of O
science O
with O
technology O
? O

How O
useful O
is O
the O
Mitcham O
framework O
in O
thinking O
about O
technology O
in O
South O
Africa O
? O

Can O
a O
measure O
of O
cooperation O
as O
opposed O
to O
competition O
be O
achieved O
amongst O
higher O

? O

Who O
ultimately O
is O
responsible O
for O
vocational O
training O
and O
what O
is O
the O
role O
of O
technology O
in O
this O
? O

During O
the O
1970s O
to O
early O
1990s O
, O
the O
term O
was O
used O
to O
describe O
state O
owned O
and O
funded O
technical O
schools O
that O
offered O
both O
vocational O
and O
higher O
education O
. O

They O
were O
part O
of O
the O
College B-KP
of I-KP
Advanced I-KP
Education I-KP
system I-KP
. O

In O
the O
1990s O
most O
of O
these O
merged O
with O
existing O
universities O
, O
or O
formed O
new O
ones O
of O
their O
own O
. O

These O
new O
universities O
often O
took O
the O
title O
University B-KP
of I-KP
Technology I-KP
, O
for O
marketing O
rather O
than O
legal O
purposes O
. O

The O
most O
prominent O
such O
university O
in O
each O
state O
founded O
the O
Australian O
Technology O
Network O
a O
few O
years O
later O
. O

Since O
the O
mid O
1990s O
, O
the O
term O
has O
been O
applied O
to O
some O
technically O
minded O
technical O
and O
further O
education O
( O
TAFE B-KP
) O
institutes O
. O

A O
recent O
example O
is O
the O
Melbourne B-KP
Polytechnic I-KP
rebranding O
and O
repositioning O
in O
2014 O
from O
Northern O
Melbourne O
Institute O
of O

These O
primarily O
offer O
vocational O
education O
, O
although O
some O
like O
Melbourne O
Polytechnic O
are O
expanding O
into O
higher O
education O
offering O
vocationally O
oriented O
applied O
bachelor O

. O

This O
usage O
of O
the O
term O
is O
most O
prevalent O
historically O
in O
NSW O
and O
the O
ACT O
. O

The O
new O
terminology O
is O
apt O
given O
that O
this O
category O
of O
institution O
are O
becoming O
very O
much O
like O
the O
institutes O
of O

This O
was O
unsuccessful O
and O
in O
1588 B-KP
the O

became O
a O

The O
Union O

Utrecht O
is O
regarded O
as O
the O
foundation O

the O
Republic O
of O
the O
Seven O

which O
was O
not O
recognized O
by O

the O

The O
Republic O

lasted O
until O
a B-KP
series I-KP
of I-KP
republican I-KP
revolutions I-KP
in I-KP
1783 I-KP
1795 I-KP
created O
the B-KP

During O
this O
period O
, O
republican O
forces O
took O
several O
major O
cities O
of O
the O
Netherlands O

After O
initially O
fleeing O

the O
monarchist O
forces O
came O
back O
with O
British O
, O
Austrian O
, O
and O
Prussian O
troops O
and O
retook O
the O
Netherlands O
. O

The O
republican O
forces O
fled O
to O
France B-KP
, O
but O
then O
successfully O
re O
invaded O
alongside O
the O
army O
of O
the O
French O
republic O
. O

After O
the O
French O
Republic O
became O
the O
French O
Empire O
under O
Napoleon O
, O
the O
Batavian O
Republic O
was O
replaced O
by O
the O
Napoleonic O
Kingdom O
of O
Holland O
. O

The O
Netherlands O
regained O
independence O
from O
France O
in O
1813 B-KP

In O
the O
Anglo O

Treaty O

1814 O
the O
names O
`` O

After O

became O
unequivocally O
known O

as O
it O
remains O
today O

During O
the B-KP
Dutch I-KP
Golden I-KP
Age I-KP
in O
the O
late O
16th O
century O
onward O
, O
the O
Dutch O
Republic O
dominated O

in O
the O
17th O

conquering O
a O
vast O
colonial O
empire O
and O
operating O
the O
largest O
fleet O
of O

of O
any O
nation O
. O

The B-KP
County I-KP
of I-KP
Holland I-KP
was O
the O
wealthiest O
and O
most O
urbanized O
region O
in O
the O
world O
. O

The O
free O
trade O
spirit O
of O
the O
time O
received O
a O
strong O
augmentation O
through O
the O
development O
of O
a O
modern O
, O
effective O
stock O
market O
in O
the O
Low O
Countries O
. O

The O
Netherlands O
has O
the O
oldest O
stock O

in O
the O
world O
, O
founded O
in O
1602 B-KP
by O
the O
Dutch O
East O
India O
Company O

While O
Rotterdam B-KP
has O
the O
oldest O
bourse O
in O
the O
Netherlands O
, O
the O
world O
's O
first O
stock O
exchange O
that O
of O
the O
Dutch O
East O
India O
Company O
went O
public O
in O
six B-KP
different O
cities O
. O

Later O
, O
a O
court O
ruled O
that O
the O
company O
had O
to O
reside O
legally O
in O
a O
single O
city O
, O
so O
Amsterdam B-KP
is O
recognized O
as O
the O
oldest O
such O
institution O
based O
on O
modern O
trading O
principles O
. O

While O
the O
banking O
system O
evolved O
in O
the O
Low O
Countries O
, O
it O
was O
quickly O
incorporated O
by O
the O

Between O
1590 B-KP
1712 I-KP
the O
Dutch O
also O
possessed O
one O
of O
the O
strongest O

The O
republic O
was O
a O
confederation O
of O
seven B-KP
provinces O
, O
which O
had O
their O
own O
governments O
and O
were O
very O
independent O

and O
a O

The O
provinces O

In O
fact O

there O
was O
an O
eighth O

the B-KP

this B-KP

as O
a O
consequence O

denied O

Each O

the O
Provincial O

the O
main O

who O
commanded O

In O

Zeeland B-KP

usually I-KP
Utrecht I-KP
had O
the O

There O
was O
a O

William B-KP

been O
a O
strong O
supporter O

In O

Catholic B-KP

all O

During O

Symbiosis O
( O
from O
Greek B-KP
`` O
together O
'' O
and O
`` O
living O
'' O
) O
is O
close O
and O
often O
long O
term O
interaction O
between O
two O
different O
biological O
species O
. O

In O
1877 O
Albert O
Bernhard O
Frank O
used O
the O
word O
symbiosis O
( O
which O
previously O
had O
been O
used O
to O
depict O
people O
living O
together O
in O
community O
) O
to O
describe O
the O
mutualistic O
relationship O
in O
lichens B-KP
. O

In O
1879 O
, O
the O
German B-KP
mycologist O
Heinrich O
Anton O
de O
Bary O
defined O
it O
as O
`` O
the O
living O
together O
of O
unlike O
organisms O
. O
'' O

The O
definition O
of O
symbiosis O
has O
varied O
among O
scientists O
. O

Some O
believe O
symbiosis O
should O
only O
refer O
to O
persistent O
mutualisms O
, O
while O
others O
believe O
it O
should O
apply O
to O
any O
type O
of O
persistent O
biological O
interaction O
( O
in O
other O
words O
mutualistic O
, O
commensalistic O
, O
or O
parasitic O
) O
. O

After O
130 B-KP
years I-KP
of O
debate O
, O
current O
biology O
and O
ecology O
textbooks O
now O
use O
the O
latter O
`` O
de O
Bary O
'' O
definition O
or O
an O
even O
broader O
definition O
( O
where O
symbiosis O
means O
all O
species O
interactions O
) O
, O
with O
the O
restrictive O
definition O
no O
longer O
used O
( O
in O
other O
words O
, O
symbiosis O
means O
mutualism O
) O
. O

Some O
symbiotic O
relationships O
are O
obligate B-KP
, O
meaning O
that O
both O
symbionts O
entirely O
depend O
on O
each O
other O
for O
survival O
. O

For O
example O
, O
many O
lichens B-KP
consist O
of O
fungal O
and O
photosynthetic O
symbionts O
that O
can O
not O
live O
on O
their O
own O
. O

Others O
are O
facultative B-KP
( O
optional O
) O
: O
they O
can O
, O
but O
do O
not O
have O
to O
live O
with O
the O
other O
organism O
. O

Symbiotic O
relationships O
include O
those O
associations O
in O
which O
one O
organism O
lives O
on O
another O
( O
ectosymbiosis O
, O
such O
as O
mistletoe B-KP

Symbiosis O
is O
also O
classified O
by O
physical O

of O
the O
organisms O
; O
symbiosis O
in O
which O
the O
organisms O
have O
bodily O
union O
is O
called O
conjunctive O
symbiosis O

and O
symbiosis O
in O
which O
they O
are O
not O
in O

is O
called O
disjunctive B-KP
symbiosis I-KP
. O

Endosymbiosis O
is O
any O
symbiotic O

in O
which O
one O
symbiont O
lives O
within O
the O

Ectosymbiosis O
, O
also O
referred O
to O
as O
exosymbiosis B-KP
, O
is O
any O
symbiotic O
relationship O
in O
which O
the O
symbiont O
lives O
on O
the O
body O
surface O
of O
the O

, O
including O
the O
inner O
surface O
of O
the O
digestive O

. O

Examples O
of O
this O
include O
ectoparasites O
such O
as O
lice B-KP
, O
commensal O
ectosymbionts O
such O
as O
the O
barnacles B-KP

Mutualism O
or O
interspecies B-KP
reciprocal I-KP
altruism I-KP
is O
a O
relationship O
between O
individuals O
of O

individuals O
benefit O
. O

In O
general O
, O
only O
lifelong B-KP
interactions O
involving O
close O
physical O
and O
biochemical O
contact O
can O
properly O
be O
considered O
symbiotic O

Mutualistic O
relationships O
may O
be O
either O
obligate O
for O
both O
species O
, O
obligate O
for O
one O
but O
facultative O
for O
the O
other O
, O
or O
facultative O
for O
both O
. O

Many O
biologists O
restrict O
the O
definition O
of O
symbiosis O
to O
close O
mutualist O
relationships O
. O

A O
large O
percentage O
of O
herbivores O
have O
mutualistic B-KP
gut O
flora O
that O
help O
them O
digest O
plant O
matter O
, O
which O
is O
more O
difficult O
to O
digest O
than O
animal O
prey O
. O

This O
gut O
flora O
is O
made O
up O
of O
cellulose O
digesting O
protozoans O
or O
bacteria O
living O
in O
the O
herbivores O

Coral B-KP
reefs I-KP
are O
the O
result O
of O
mutualisms O
between O
coral O
organisms O
and O
various O
types O
of O
algae O
that O
live O
inside O
them O
. O

Most O
land O
plants O
and O
land O
ecosystems O
rely O
on O
mutualisms O
between O
the O
plants O
, O
which O
fix B-KP
carbon I-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
air I-KP
, O
and O
mycorrhyzal B-KP
fungi O
, O
which O
help O
in O
extracting O
water O
and O
minerals O
from O
the O
ground O
. O

An O
example O
of O
mutual B-KP
symbiosis I-KP
is O
the O
relationship O
between O
the O
ocellaris B-KP
clownfish I-KP
that O
dwell O
among O
the O
tentacles O
of O
Ritteri O
sea O
anemones O
. O

The O
territorial O
fish O
protects O
the O
anemone O
from O
anemone O
eating O
fish O
, O
and O
in O
turn O
the O
stinging O
tentacles O
of O
the O
anemone O
protect O
the O
clownfish O
from O
its O
predators O
. O

A B-KP
special I-KP
mucus I-KP
on O
the O
clownfish O
protects O
it O
from O
the O
stinging O
tentacles O
. O

A O
further O
example O
is O
the B-KP
goby I-KP
fish I-KP
, O
which O
sometimes O
lives O
together O
with O
a O
shrimp O
. O

The O
shrimp O
digs O
and O
cleans O
up O
a O
burrow O
in O
the O
sand O
in O
which O
both O
the O
shrimp O
and O
the O
goby O
fish O
live O
. O

The O
shrimp O
is O
almost O
blind O
, O
leaving O
it O
vulnerable O
to O
predators O
when O
outside O
its O
burrow O
. O

In O
case O
of O
danger O
the O
goby O
fish O
touches O
the O
shrimp O
with O
its B-KP
tail I-KP
to O
warn O
it O
. O

When O
that O
happens O
both O
the O
shrimp O
and O
goby O
fish O
quickly O
retreat O
into O
the O
burrow O
. O

Different O
species O
of O
gobies O
( O
Elacatinus O
spp O
. O
) O

also O
exhibit O
mutualistic O
behavior O
through O
cleaning O
up O
ectoparasites O
in O
other O
fish O
. O

Another O
non B-KP
obligate I-KP
symbiosis O
is O
known O
from O
encrusting O
bryozoans O
and O
hermit O
crabs O
that O
live O
in O
a O
close O
relationship O
. O

The O
bryozoan O
colony O
( O
Acanthodesia O
commensale O
) O
develops O
a O
cirumrotatory O
growth O
and O
offers O
the O
crab O
( O
Pseudopagurus O
granulimanus O
) O
a O
helicospiral O
tubular O
extension O
of O
its O
living O
chamber O
that O
initially O
was O
situated O
within O
a O
gastropod O
shell O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
examples O
of O
obligate O
mutualism O
is O
between O
the O
siboglinid O
tube O
worms O
and O
symbiotic O
bacteria O
that O
live O
at O
hydrothermal O
vents O
and O
cold O
seeps O
. O

The O
worm O
has O
no O
digestive O
tract O
and O
is O
wholly O
reliant O
on O
its O
internal O
symbionts O
for O
nutrition B-KP
. O

The O
bacteria O
oxidize O
either O
hydrogen O
sulfide O
or O
methane O
, O
which O
the O
host O
supplies O
to O
them O
. O

These O
worms O
were O
discovered O
in O
the B-KP
late I-KP
1980s I-KP
at O
the O
hydrothermal O
vents O
near O
the B-KP
Galapagos I-KP
Islands I-KP
and O
have O
since O
been O
found O
at O
deep O
sea O
hydrothermal O
vents O
and O
cold O
seeps O
in O
all O
of O
the O
world O
's O
oceans O
. O

During O
mutualistic O
symbioses O
, O
the O
host O
cell O
lacks O
some O
of O
the O
nutrients B-KP
, O
which O
are O
provided O
by O
the O
endosymbiont O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
host O
favors O
endosymbiont O
's O
growth O
processes O
within O
itself O
by O
producing O
some O
specialized B-KP
cells I-KP
. O

These O
cells O
affect O
the O
genetic O
composition O
of O
the O
host O
in O
order O
to O
regulate O
the O
increasing O
population O
of O
the O
endosymbionts O
and O
ensuring O
that O
these O
genetic O
changes O
are O
passed O
onto O
the O
offspring O
via O
vertical B-KP
transmission I-KP
( O
heredity O
) O
. O

Adaptation O
of O
the O
endosymbiont O
to O
the O
host O
's O
lifestyle O
leads O
to O
many O
changes O
in O
the O
endosymbiont O
the O
foremost O
being O
drastic B-KP
reduction I-KP
in I-KP
its I-KP
genome I-KP
size I-KP
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
many O
genes O
being O
lost O
during O
the O
process O
of O
metabolism O
, O
and O
DNA O
repair O
and O
recombination O
. O

While O
important O
genes O
participating O
in O
the O
DNA O
to O
RNA O
transcription O
, O
protein O
translation O
and O
DNA/RNA O
replication O
are O
retained O
. O

That O
is O
, O
a O
decrease O
in O
genome O
size O
is O
due O
to O
loss O
of O
protein O
coding O
genes O
and O
not O
due O
to O
lessening O
of O
inter O
genic O
regions O
or O
open O
reading O
frame O
( O
ORF O
) O
size O
. O

Thus O
, O
species O
that O
are O
naturally O
evolving O
and O
contain O
reduced O
sizes O
of O
genes O
can O
be O
accounted O
for O
an O
increased O
number O
of O
noticeable O
differences O
between O
them O
, O
thereby O
leading O
to O
changes O
in O
their O
evolutionary O
rates O
. O

As O
the O
endosymbiotic O
bacteria O
related O
with O
these O
insects O
are O
passed O
on O
to O
the O
offspring O
strictly O
via O
vertical O
genetic O
transmission O
, O
intracellular O
bacteria O
goes O
through O
many O
hurdles O
during O
the O
process O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
decrease O
in O
effective O
population O
sizes O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
free O
living O
bacteria O
. O

This O
incapability O
of O
the O
endosymbiotic O
bacteria O
to O
reinstate O
its O
wild O
type O
phenotype O
via O
a O
recombination O
process O
is O
called O
as O
Muller B-KP

ratchet I-KP
phenomenon I-KP
. O

Muller O
's O
ratchet O
phenomenon O
together O
with O
less O
effective O
population O

has O
led O
to O
an O
accretion O
of O
deleterious O
mutations O
in O
the O
non O
essential O
genes O
of O
the O
intracellular O
bacteria O
. O

This O
could O
have O
been O
due O
to O
lack B-KP
of I-KP
selection I-KP
mechanisms I-KP
prevailing O
in O
the O
rich O
environment O
of O
the O

Commensalism B-KP
describes O
a O
relationship O
between O
two O
living O
organisms O
where O
one O
benefits O
and O
the O
other O
is O
not O
significantly O
harmed O
or O
helped O
. O

It O
is O
derived O
from O
the O
English O
word O
commensal O
used O
of O
human O
social O
interaction O
. O

The O
word O
derives O
from O
the O
medieval O
Latin B-KP
word O
, O
formed O
from O
com O
and O
mensa O
, O
meaning O
`` O
sharing O
a O
table O
'' O
. O

Commensal O
relationships O
may O
involve O
one O
organism O
using O
another O
for O
transportation O
( O
phoresy B-KP
) O
or O
for O
housing O
( O
inquilinism B-KP
) O
, O
or O
it O
may O
also O
involve O
one O
organism O
using O
something O
another O
created O
, O
after O
its O
death O
( O
metabiosis B-KP
) O
. O

Examples O
of O
metabiosis O
are O
hermit O
crabs O
using O
gastropod O
shells O
to O
protect O
their O
bodies O
and O
spiders O
building O
their O

A B-KP
parasitic I-KP
relationship I-KP
is O
one O
in O
which O
one O
member O
of O
the O
association O
benefits O
while O
the O
other O
is O
harmed O
. O

This O
is O
also O
known O
as O
antagonistic O
or O
antipathetic O
symbiosis O
. O

Parasitic O
symbioses O
take O
many O
forms O
, O
from O
endoparasites O
that O
live O
within O
the O
host O
's O
body O
to O
ectoparasites O
that O
live O
on O
its O
surface O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
parasites O
may O
be O
necrotrophic B-KP
, O
which O
is O
to O
say O
they O
kill O
their O
host O
, O
or O
biotrophic B-KP
, O
meaning O
they O
rely O
on O
their O
host O
's O
surviving O
. O

Biotrophic O
parasitism O
is O
an O
extremely O
successful O
mode O
of O
life O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
definition O
used O
, O
as B-KP
many I-KP
as I-KP
half I-KP
of O
all O
animals O
have O
at O
least O
one O
parasitic O
phase O
in O
their O
life O
cycles O
, O
and O
it O
is O
also O
frequent O
in O
plants O
and O
fungi O
. O

Moreover O
, O
almost O
all O
free O
living O
animals O
are O
host O
to O
one O
or O
more O
parasite O
taxa O
. O

An O
example O
of O
a O
biotrophic O
relationship O
would O
be O
a B-KP
tick I-KP
feeding O
on O
the O
blood O
of O
its O

Amensalism B-KP
is O
the O
type O
of O
relationship O
that O
exists O
where O
one O
species O
is O
inhibited O
or O
completely O
obliterated O
and O
one O
is O
unaffected O
. O

This O
type O
of O
symbiosis O
is O
relatively O
uncommon O
in O
rudimentary O
reference O
texts O
, O
but O
is O
omnipresent O
in O
the O
natural O
world O
. O

[ O
citation O
needed O
] O
There O
are O
two O
types O
of O
amensalism O
, O
competition B-KP
and I-KP
antibiosis I-KP
. O

Competition O
is O
where O
a O
larger O
or O
stronger O
organisms O
deprives O
a O
smaller O
or O
weaker O
one O
from O
a O
resource O
. O

Antibiosis O
occurs O
when O
one O
organism O
is O
damaged O
or O
killed O
by O
another O
through O
a O
chemical O
secretion O
. O

An O
example O
of O
competition O
is O
a O
sapling O
growing O
under O
the O
shadow O
of O
a O
mature O
tree O
. O

The O
mature O
tree O
can O
begin O
to O
rob O
the O
sapling O
of O
necessary O
sunlight O
and O
, O
if O
the O
mature O
tree O
is O
very O
large O
, O
it O
can O
take O
up O
rainwater O
and O
deplete O
soil O
nutrients O
. O

Throughout O
the O
process O
the O
mature O
tree O
is O
unaffected O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
the O
sapling O
dies O
, O
the O
mature O
tree O
gains O
nutrients O
from O
the O
decaying O
sapling O
. O

An O

Juglans O

Amensalism B-KP
is O
an O
interaction O
where O
an O
organism O
inflicts O
harm O
to O
another O
organism O
without O
any O
costs O
or O
benefits O
received O
by O
the O
other O
. O

A O
clear O
case O
of O
amensalism O
is O
where O
sheep O
or O
cattle O
trample O
grass O
. O

Whilst O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
grass O
causes O
negligible O
detrimental O
effects O
to O
the O
animal O

, O
the O
grass O
suffers O
from O

Amensalism O
is O
often O
used O
to O
describe O
strongly O
asymmetrical O
competitive O
interactions O
, O
such O
as O
has O
been O
observed O
between O
the O
Spanish O
ibex O
and O
weevils B-KP
of O
the O
genus O
Timarcha O
which O
feed O
upon O
the O
same O
type O
of O
shrub B-KP
. O

Whilst O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
weevil O
has O
almost O
no O
influence O
on O
food O
availability O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
ibex O
has O
an O
enormous O
detrimental O
effect O
on O
weevil O
numbers O
, O
as O
they O
consume O
significant O
quantities O
of O
plant O
matter O
and O
incidentally O
ingest O
the O
weevils O
upon O
it O

Synnecrosis B-KP
is O
a O
rare O
type O
of O
symbiosis O
in O
which O
the O
interaction O
between O
species O
is O
detrimental O
to O
both O
organisms O
involved O
. O

It O
is O
a O
short O
lived O
condition O
, O
as O
the O
interaction O
eventually O
causes O
death B-KP
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
evolution O
selects O
against O
synnecrosis O
and O
it O
is O
uncommon B-KP
in O
nature O
. O

An O
example O
of O
this O
is O
the O
relationship O
between O
some O
species O
of O
bees O
and O
victims O
of O
the O
bee O
sting O
. O

Species O

bees O

die O

their O
prey O
inflict O
pain O

themselves O
( O

the I-KP

as O
well O
as O
on O
the O
victim O
. O

This O
term O
is O
rarely O
used O
. O

While O
historically O
, O
symbiosis O
has O
received O
less O
attention O
than O
other O
interactions O
such O
as O
predation O
or O
competition O
, O
it O
is O
increasingly O
recognized O
as O
an O
important O
selective O
force O
behind O
evolution O

with O
many O
species O
having O
a O
long O
history O

In O

the B-KP

( O
plants B-KP
, I-KP

is O
believed O
under O
the O
endosymbiotic O
theory O
to O
have O
resulted O
from O
a O
symbiosis O
between O
various O
sorts O
of O

This O
theory O
is O
supported O
by O
certain O

dividing O
independently O
of O
the O
cell O
, O
and O
the O
observation O
that O
some O

seem O
to O

The O
biologist O
Lynn O
Margulis O
, O
famous O
for O
her O
work O
on O
endosymbiosis O
, O
contends O
that O
symbiosis O
is O
a O
major O
driving O
force O
behind O
evolution O
. O

She O
considers O
Darwin O
's O
notion O
of O
evolution O
, O
driven O
by O
competition O
, O
to O
be O
incomplete O
and O
claims O
that O
evolution O
is O
strongly O
based O
on O
co O
operation O
, O
interaction O
, O

mutual O

According O

Symbiosis O
played O
a B-KP
major I-KP
role I-KP
in O
the O
co O
evolution O
of O
flowering O
plants O

the O

Many O
plants O
that O
are O
pollinated O
by O
insects O

have O
highly O

a O

pollinator O
that O

The O
first O
flowering O
plants O
in O
the O
fossil O
record O
had O
relatively O
simple O
flowers O

Adaptive O
speciation O
quickly O

at O
the O

time O
, O

In O
some O

Its O

More O

were O
also O
put O
towards O
recruitment O
, O
which O
had O
been O
dwindling O
throughout O
the O
1980s O
and O
'90s O
, O
possibly O
because O
the O
Canadian O
populace O
had O
come O
to O
perceive O
the O
CAF O
as O
peacekeepers O
rather O
than O
as O
soldiers O
, O
as O
shown O
in O
a O
2008 O
survey O
conducted O
for O
the O
Department O
of O
National O

The O
poll O
found O
that O
nearly O
two O
thirds O
of O
Canadians O
agreed O
with O
the O
country O

participation O
in O
the O
invasion O
of O
Afghanistan O
, O
and O
that O
the O
military O
should O
be O
stronger O
, O
but O
also O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
forces O
should O
be O
different O
, O
such O
as O
more O
focused O
on O
responding O
to O
natural O

Then O
CDS O
, O
Walter O
Natynczyk O
, O
said O
later O
that O
year O
that O
while O

has O
become O
more O
successful O
, O
the O
CF O
was O
facing O
a O

with O
its O

The O

The B-KP
Church I-KP
of I-KP
England I-KP
retains O
an O
instance O
of O
this O
origin O
of O
the O
title O
, O
which O
is O
held O
by O
the O
two O
senior O
members O
of O
the O
College O
of O
Minor O
Canons O
of O
St O
Paul O
's O
Cathedral O
. O

There O
is O
disagreement O
about O
the O
origin O
of O
the O
term O
, O
but O
general O
consensus O
that O
`` O
cardinalis O
'' O
from O
the O
word O
cardo O
( O
meaning O
'pivot O
' O
or O
'hinge O
' O
) O
was O
first O
used O
in O
late O
antiquity O
to O
designate O
a O
bishop O
or O
priest O
who O
was O
incorporated O
into O
a O
church O
for O
which O
he O
had O
not O
originally O
been O
ordained O
. O

In O
Rome O
the O
first O
persons O
to O
be O
called O
cardinals O
were O
the B-KP
deacons I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
seven I-KP
regions I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
city I-KP
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
6th O
century O
, O
when O
the O
word O
began O
to O
mean O
principal O
, O
eminent O
, O
or O
`` O
superior O
. O
'' O

The O
name O
was O
also O
given O
to O
the O
senior O
priest O
in O
each O
of O
the O
`` O
title O
'' O
churches O
( O
the O
parish O
churches O
) O
of O
Rome O
and O
to O
the O
bishops O
of O
the O
seven O
sees O
surrounding O
the O
city O
. O

By O
the O
8th B-KP
century I-KP
the O
Roman O
cardinals O
constituted O
a O
privileged O
class O
among O
the O
Roman O
clergy O
. O

They O
took O
part O
in O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
church O
of O
Rome O
and O
in O
the O
papal O
liturgy O
. O

By O
decree O
of O
a O
synod O
of O
769 B-KP
, O
only O
a O
cardinal O
was O
eligible O
to O
become O
pope O
. O

In O
1059 O
, O
during O
the O
pontificate O
of O
Nicholas B-KP
II I-KP
, O
cardinals O
were O
given O
the O
right O
to O
elect O
the O
pope O
under O
the B-KP
Papal I-KP
Bull I-KP
In I-KP
nomine I-KP
Domini I-KP
. O

For O
a O
time O
this O
power O
was O
assigned O
exclusively O
to O
the O
cardinal O
bishops O
, O
but O
the O
Third O
Lateran O
Council O
in O
1179 O
gave O
back O
the O
right O
to O
the O
whole O
body O
of O
cardinals O
. O

Cardinals O
were O
granted O
the O
privilege O
of O
wearing O
the O
red O
hat O
by O
Pope B-KP
Innocent I-KP
IV I-KP
in O
1244 B-KP
. O

In O
cities O
other O
than O
Rome O
, O
the O
name O
cardinal B-KP
began O
to O
be O
applied O
to O
certain O
church O
men O
as O
a O
mark O
of O
honour O
. O

The O
earliest O
example O
of O
this O
occurs O
in O
a O
letter O
sent O
by O
Pope B-KP
Zacharias I-KP
in O
747 B-KP
to O
Pippin O
III O
( O
the O
Short O
) O
, O
ruler O
of O
the O
Franks O
, O
in O
which O
Zacharias O
applied O
the O
title O
to O
the O
priests O
of O
Paris O
to O
distinguish O
them O
from O
country O
clergy O
. O

This O
meaning O
of O
the O
word O
spread O
rapidly O
, O
and O
from O
the O
9th O
century O
various O
episcopal O
cities O
had O
a O
special O
class O
among O
the O
clergy O
known O
as O
cardinals O
. O

The O
use O
of O
the O
title O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
cardinals O
of O
Rome O
in O
1567 B-KP
by O

In O
the O

the O
influential O
Ecumenical O
Council O
of O
Trent O
, O
headed O
by O
Pope B-KP
Pius I-KP
IV I-KP
, O
wrote O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
selecting O
good O
Cardinals O
. O

According O
to O
this O
historic O
council O
`` O

's O
primary O
duty O
is O
electing O
the O
pope O
when O
the O
see O
becomes O
vacant O
. O

During O
the O
sede O
vacante O
( O
the O
period O
between O
a O
pope O
's O
death O
or O
resignation O
and O
the O
election O
of O
his O
successor O
) O
, O
the O
day O
to O
day O
governance O
of O
the O
Holy O
See O
is O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
College O
of O
Cardinals O
. O

The O
right O
to O
enter O
the O
conclave O
of O
cardinals O
where O
the O
pope O
is O
elected O
is O
limited O
to O
those O
who O
have O
not O
reached O
the O
age O
of O
80 O
years O
by O
the O
day O
the O
vacancy O
occurs O
. O

Cardinals O
have O
in O
canon O
law O
a O
`` O
privilege O
of O
forum O
'' O
( O
i.e. O
, O
exemption O
from O
being O
judged O
by O
ecclesiastical O
tribunals O
of O
ordinary O
rank O
) O
: O
only O
the B-KP
pope I-KP
is O
competent O
to O
judge O
them O
in O
matters O
subject O
to O
ecclesiastical O
jurisdiction O
( O
cases O
that O
refer O
to O
matters O
that O
are O
spiritual O
or O
linked O
with O
the O
spiritual O
, O
or O
with O
regard O
to O
infringement O
of O
ecclesiastical O
laws O
and O
whatever O
contains O
an O
element O
of O
sin O
, O
where O
culpability O
must O
be O
determined O
and O
the O
appropriate O
ecclesiastical O
penalty O
imposed O
) O
. O

The O
pope O
either O
decides O
the O
case O
himself O
or O
delegates O
the O
decision O
to O
a O
tribunal O
, O
usually O
one O
of O
the O
tribunals O
or O
congregations O
of O
the O
Roman O
Curia O
. O

Without O
such O
delegation O
, O
no O
ecclesiastical O
court O
, O
even O
the O
Roman O
Rota O
, O
is O
competent O
to O
judge O
a O
canon O
law O
case O
against O
a O
cardinal O
. O

Cardinals O
are O
, O
however O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
civil O
and O
criminal O
law O
like O
everybody O
else O
. O

To O
symbolize O
their O
bond O
with O
the O
papacy O
, O
the B-KP
pope I-KP
gives O
each O
newly O
appointed O
cardinal O
a B-KP
gold I-KP
ring I-KP
, O
which O
is O
traditionally O
kissed O
by O
Catholics O
when O
greeting O
a O
cardinal O
( O
as O
with O
a O
bishop O
's O
episcopal O
ring O
) O
. O

The O
pope O
chooses O
the O
image O
on O
the O
outside O
: O
under O
Pope O
Benedict O
XVI O
it O
was O
a O
modern O
depiction O
of O
the O
crucifixion O
of O
Jesus O
, O
with O
Mary O
and O
John O
to O
each O
side O

The O
ring O
includes O
the O
pope O

coat O
of O

In O
previous O
times O
, O
at O
the O
consistory O
at O
which O
the O
pope O
named O
a O
new O
cardinal O
, O
he O
would O
bestow O
upon O
him O
a O
distinctive O
wide O
brimmed O
hat O
called O
a B-KP
galero I-KP
. I-KP

This O
custom O
was O
discontinued O
in O
1969 B-KP
and O
the O
investiture O
now O
takes O
place O
with O
the O
scarlet B-KP

, O
the O
scarlet O
galero O
is O

the O
cardinal O

Cardinals O
had O
the O
right O
to O
display O
the O
galero O
in O
their O
cathedral O
, O
and O
when O
a O
cardinal O
died O
, O
it O
would O
be O
suspended O
from O
the O
ceiling O
above O
his O
tomb O

Some O
cardinals O
will O
still O
have O
a O

Eastern B-KP
Catholic I-KP
cardinals I-KP
continue O
to O
wear O
the O
normal O
dress O
appropriate O
to O
their O
liturgical O
tradition O
, O
though O
some O
may O
line O
their O
cassocks O
with O
scarlet O
and O
wear O
scarlet O
fascias O
, O
or O
in O
some O
cases O
, O
wear O
Eastern O
style O
cassocks O

of O
scarlet O

a O
Latin O
rite O
cardinal O
wears O
scarlet O

a O
cardinal O

willingness B-KP
to I-KP
die I-KP
for I-KP
his I-KP
faith I-KP

Excluding O
the O
rochet B-KP
which O
is O
always O
white O
the O
scarlet O
garments O
include O
the O
cassock O
, O
mozzetta O
, O
and O
biretta O
( O
over O
the O
usual O
scarlet O
zucchetto O
) O
. O

The O
biretta O
of O
a O
cardinal O
is O
distinctive O
not O
merely O
for O
its O
scarlet O
color O
, O
but O
also O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
pompon O
or O
tassel O
on O
the O
top O
as O
do O
the O
birettas O
of O
other O
prelates O
. O

Until O
the O
1460s B-KP
, O
it O
was O
customary O
for O
cardinals O
to O
wear O
a O
violet O
or O
blue O
cape O
unless O
granted O
the O
privilege O
of O
wearing O
red O
when O
acting O
on O
papal O
business O
. O

His O
normal O
wear O
cassock O
is O
black O
but O
has O
scarlet O
piping O
and O
a O
scarlet O
fascia O
( O
sash O
) O
. O

Occasionally O
, O
a O
cardinal O
wears O
a O
scarlet O
ferraiolo O
which O
is O
a O
cape O
worn O
over O
the O
shoulders O
, O
tied O
at O
the O
neck O
in O
a O
bow O
by O
narrow O
strips O
of O
cloth O
in O
the O
front O
, O
without O
any O
'trim O
' O
or O
piping O
on O
it O
. O

It O
is O
because O
of O
the B-KP
scarlet I-KP
color I-KP
of I-KP
cardinals I-KP
' I-KP
vesture I-KP
that O
the O

If O
conditions O
change O
, O
so O
that O
the O
pope O
judges O
it O
safe O
to O
make O
the O
appointment O
public O
, O
he O
may O
do O
so O
at O
any O
time O
. O

The O
cardinal O
in O
question O
then O
ranks O
in O
precedence O
with O
those O
raised O
to O
the O
cardinalate O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
in O
pectore O
appointment O

If O
a O
pope O
dies O
before O
revealing O
the O
identity O
of O
an O
in O
pectore O
cardinal O
, O
the B-KP
cardinalate I-KP
expires I-KP

During O
the O
Western O
Schism O
, O
many O
cardinals O
were O
created O
by O
the O
contending O
popes O
. O

Beginning O
with O
the O
reign O
of O
Pope B-KP
Martin I-KP
V I-KP
, O
cardinals O
were O
created O
without O
publishing O
their O
names O
until O
later O
, O
termed O
creati O
et O
reservati O
in O
pectore O
. O

At O
various O
times O
, O
there O
have O
been O
cardinals O
who O
had O
only O
received O
first O
tonsure O
and O
minor O
orders O
but O
not O
yet O
been O
ordained O
as O
deacons O
or O
priests O
. O

Though O
clerics O
, O
they O
were O
inaccurately O
called O
`` O
lay O
cardinals O
'' O
and O
were O
permitted O
to O
marry B-KP
. O

Teodolfo O
Mertel O
was O
among O
the O
last O
of O
the O
lay O
cardinals O
. O

When O
he O
died O
in O
1899 O
he O
was O
the O
last O
surviving O
cardinal O
who O
was O
not O
at O
least O
ordained O
a O
priest O
. O

With O
the O
revision O
of O
the O
Code O
of O
Canon O
Law O
promulgated O
in O
1917 B-KP
by O
Pope O
Benedict O
XV O
, O
only B-KP
those I-KP
who I-KP
are I-KP
already I-KP
priests I-KP
or I-KP
bishops I-KP
may I-KP
be I-KP
appointed I-KP
cardinals I-KP
. O

Since O
the O
time O
of O
Pope O
John O
XXIII O
a O
priest O
who O
is O
appointed O
a O
cardinal O
must O
be O
consecrated O
a O
bishop O
, O
unless O
he O
obtains O
a O
dispensation O
. O

A O
cardinal O
who O
is O
not O
a O
bishop O
is O
still O
entitled O
to O
wear O
and O
use O
the O
episcopal O
vestments O
and O
other O
pontificalia O
( O
episcopal O
regalia O
: O
mitre O
, O
crozier O
, O
zucchetto O
, O
pectoral O
cross O
and O
ring O
) O
. O

Even O
if O
not O
a O
bishop O
, O
any O
cardinal O
has O
both O
actual O
and O
honorary O
precedence O
over O
non O
cardinal O
patriarchs O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
archbishops O
and O
bishops O
who O
are O
not O
cardinals O
, O
but O
he O
can O
not O
perform B-KP
the I-KP
functions I-KP
reserved I-KP
solely I-KP
to I-KP
bishops I-KP
, I-KP
such I-KP
as I-KP
ordination I-KP
. O

The O
prominent O
priests O
who O
since O
1962 B-KP
were O
not O
ordained O
bishops O
on O
their O
elevation O
to O
the O
cardinalate O
were O
over O
the O
age O
of O
80 O
or O
near O
to O
it O
, O
and O
so O
no O
cardinal O
who O
was O
not O
a O
bishop O
has O
participated O
in O
recent O
papal O
conclaves O
. O

Until O
1917 B-KP
, O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
someone O
who O
was O
not O
a O
priest O
, O
but O
only O
in O
minor O
orders O
, O
to O
become O
a O
cardinal O
( O
see O
`` O
lay O
cardinals O
'' O
, O
below O
) O
, O
but O
they O
were O
enrolled O
only O
in O
the O
order O
of O
cardinal O
deacons O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
the O
16th O
century O
, O
Reginald O
Pole O
was O
a O
cardinal O
for O
18 O
years O
before O
he O
was O
ordained O
a O
priest O
. O

In O
1917 O
it O
was O
established O
that O
all O
cardinals O
, O
even O
cardinal O
deacons O
, O
had O
to O
be O
priests O
, O
and O
, O
in O
1962 B-KP
, O
Pope O
John O
XXIII O
set O
the O
norm O
that O
all O
cardinals O
be O
ordained O
as O
bishops O
, O
even O
if O
they O
are O
only O
priests O
at O
the O
time O
of O
appointment O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
of O
these O
two O
changes O
, O
canon O
351 O
of O
the O
1983 O
Code O
of O
Canon O
Law O
requires O
that O
a O
cardinal O
be O
at O
least O
in O
the O
order O
of O
priesthood O
at O
his O
appointment O
, O
and O
that O
those O
who O
are O
not O
already O
bishops O
must O
receive O
episcopal O
consecration O
. O

Several O
cardinals O
aged O
over O
80 O
or O
close O
to O
it O
when O
appointed O
have O
obtained O
dispensation O
from O
the O
rule O
of O
having O
to O
be O
a O
bishop O
. O

These O
were O
all O
appointed O
cardinal O
deacons O
, O
but O
one O
of O
them O
, O
Roberto O
Tucci O
, O
lived O
long O
enough O
to O
exercise O
the O
right O
of O

promoted O
to O
the O
rank O
of O
cardinal O

the O
senior O
cardinal O
deacon O
in O
order O
of O

to O
the O
College O

has O
the O
privilege O

In O
the O
past O

during O
papal O
coronations O
, O
the O

also O
had O
the O
honor O
of O
bestowing O
the O
pallium O
on O
the O
new O
pope O
and O
crowning O
him O
with O
the O

However O
, O
in O
1978 O
Pope B-KP
John I-KP
Paul I-KP
I I-KP
chose O
not O
to O
be O
crowned O
and O
opted O
for O
a O
simpler O
papal O
inauguration O
ceremony O
, O
and O
his O
three O
successors O
followed O
that O
example O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
Cardinal O
protodeacon O
's O
privilege O
of O
crowning O
a O
new O

has O
effectively O
ceased O
although O
it O
could O
be O
revived O
if O
a O
future O

were O
to O
restore O
a O
coronation O

However O
, O
the O
proto O

still O
has O
the O
privilege O
of O
bestowing O
the O
pallium O
on O
a O
new O

at O
his O
papal O

Acting O

When O
not O

such O
as O
the O

, O
some O
Papal O

and O
some O
events O
at O
Ecumenical O

, O
cardinal O

can O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
dalmatics O
they O
would O
don O
with O
the O
simple O
white B-KP

( O
so O
called O
mitra O

) O
. O

As O
of O
2005 O
, O
there O
were O
over O
50 O
churches O
recognized O
as O
cardinalatial O
deaconries O
, O
though O
there O
were O
only O
30 B-KP
cardinals O
of O
the O
order O
of O
deacons O
. O

Cardinal O
deacons O
have O
long O
enjoyed O
the O
right O
to O
`` O
opt O
for O
the O
order O
of O
cardinal O
priests O
'' O
( O
optazione O
) O
after O
they O
have O
been O
cardinal O
deacons O
for O
10 B-KP
years I-KP
. O

They O
may O
on O
such O
elevation O
take O
a O
vacant O
`` O
title O
'' O
( O
a O
church O
allotted O
to O
a O
cardinal O
priest O
as O
the O
church O

Rome O
with O
which O
he O
is O

elevated O

`` O

for O
that O
occasion O

When O
elevated O
to O
cardinal O
priests O
, O
they O
take O
their O
precedence O
according O
to O
the O
day O
they O
were O
first O
made O
cardinal O
deacons O
( O
thus O
ranking O
above O
cardinal O
priests O
who O
were O
elevated O
to O
the O
college O
after O
them O
, O
regardless O
of O
order O

. O

Cardinals O
elevated O
to O
the O
diaconal O
order O
are O
mainly O
officials O
of O
the O
Roman O
Curia O
holding O
various O
posts O
in O
the O
church O
administration O
. O

Their O
number O
and O
influence O
has O
varied O
through O
the O
years O
. O

While O
historically O
predominantly O
Italian O
the O
group O
has O
become O
much O
more O
internationally O
diverse O
in O
later O
years O
. O

While O
in O
1939 O
about B-KP
half I-KP
were O
Italian O
by O
1994 O
the O
number O
was O
reduced O
to O
one O
third B-KP
. O

Their O
influence O
in O
the O
election O
of O
the O
Pope O
has O
been O
considered O
important O
, O
they O
are O
better O
informed O
and O
connected O
than O
the O
dislocated O
cardinals O
but O
their O
level O
of O
unity O
has O
been O
varied O
. O

Under O
the O
1587 O
decree O
of O
Pope O
Sixtus O
V O
, O
which O
fixed O
the O
maximum O
size O
of O
the O
College O
of O
Cardinals O
, O
there O
were O
14 O
cardinal O
deacons O
. O

Later O
the O
number O
increased O
. O

As O
late O
as O
1939 O
almost O
half O
of O
the O
cardinals O
were O
members O
of O
the O
curia O
. O

Pius O
XII O
reduced O
this O
percentage O
to O
24 O
percent O
. O

John O
XXIII O
brought O
it O
back O
up O
to O
37 O
percent O
but O
Paul O
VI O

In O

the O

is O
interpreted O
as O
meaning O
a O
cardinal O

of O
the O
Diocese O

While O
the O
cardinalate O
has O
long O
been O
expanded O
beyond O
the O
Roman O
pastoral O
clergy O
and O
Roman O
Curia O
, O
every O

While O
the O
number O

was O
small O
from O
the O
times O
of O
the O
Roman O
Empire O

the O

, O
and O
frequently O
smaller O
than O
the O

in O
the O
16th O
century O
the O
College O
expanded O
markedly O
. O

In O
1587 B-KP
, O
Pope O
Sixtus O
V O
sought O
to O
arrest O
this O
growth O
by O
fixing O
the O
maximum O
size O
of O
the O
College O
at O
70 B-KP
, O
including O
50 O
cardinal O
priests O
, O
about O
twice O
the O
historical O
number O
. O

This O
limit O
was O
respected O
until O
1958 O
, O
and O
the O
list O
of O
titular O
churches O
modified O
only O
on O
rare O
occasions O
, O
generally O
when O
a O
building O
fell O
into O
disrepair O
. O

When O
Pope B-KP
John I-KP
XXIII I-KP
abolished O
the O
limit O
, O
he O
began O
to O
add O
new O
churches O
to O
the O
list O
, O
which O
Popes O
Paul O

John O
Paul O

continued O

Today O

Some O
recent O

revived O
this O
convention O

All O

The O
multitude O
of O

indicate O
that O
great O

must O
have O
existed O
among O

. O

Of O
that O
variety O
of O
languages/dialects O
, O
direct O
evidence O
of O
only O
two B-KP
have O
survived O
. O

These O
are O
: O

Old O
Persian O
is O
the O
Old O
Iranian O
dialect O
as O
it O
was O
spoken O
in O
south O
western O
Iran O
by O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Parsa O
, O
who O
also O
gave O
their O
name O
to O
their O
region O
and O
language O
. O

Genuine O
Old O
Persian O
is O
best O
attested O
in O
one O
of O
the O
three O
languages O
of O
the B-KP
Behistun I-KP
inscription I-KP
, O
composed O
circa O
520 B-KP
BC I-KP
, O
and O
which O
is O
the O
last O
inscription O
( O
and O
only O
inscription O
of O
significant O
length O
) O
in O
which O
Old O
Persian O
is O
still O
grammatically O
correct O
. O

Later O
inscriptions O
are O
comparatively O
brief O
, O
and O
typically O
simply O
copies O
of O
words O
and O
phrases O
from O
earlier O
ones O
, O
often O
with O
grammatical O
errors O
, O
which O
suggests O
that O
by O
the O
4th B-KP
century I-KP
BC I-KP
the O
transition O
from O
Old O
Persian O
to O
Middle O
Persian O
was O
already O
far O
advanced O
, O
but O
efforts O
were O
still O
being O
made O
to O
retain O
an O
`` O
old O
'' O
quality O
for O
official O
proclamations O
. O

The O
other O
directly O
attested O
Old O
Iranian O
dialects O
are O
the O
two O
forms O
of O
Avestan B-KP
, O
which O
take O
their O
name O
from O
their O
use O
in O
the O
Avesta O
, O
the O
liturgical O
texts O
of O
indigenous O
Iranian O
religion O
that O
now O
goes O
by O
the O
name O
of O
Zoroastrianism B-KP
but O
in O
the O
Avesta O
itself O
is O
simply O
known O
as O
vohu O
daena O
( O
later O
: O
behdin O
) O
. O

The O
language O
of O
the O
Avesta O
is O
subdivided O
into O
two O
dialects O
, O
conventionally O
known O
as O
`` O
Old O
( O
or O
'Gathic O
' O
) O
Avestan O
'' O
, O
and O
`` O
Younger O
Avestan O
'' O
. O

These O
terms O
, O
which O
date O
to O
the O
19th O
century O
, O
are O
slightly O
misleading O
since O
'Younger O
Avestan O
' O
is O
not O
only O
much O
younger O
than O
'Old O
Avestan O
' O
, O
but O
also O
from O
a O
different O
geographic O
region O
. O

The O
Old O
Avestan O
dialect O
is O
very O
archaic O
, O
and O
at O
roughly O
the O
same O
stage O
of O
development O
as O
Rigvedic B-KP
Sanskrit I-KP
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Younger O
Avestan O
is O
at O
about O
the O
same O
linguistic O
stage O
as O
Old B-KP
Persian I-KP
, O
but O
by O
virtue O
of O
its O
use O
as O
a O
sacred O
language O
retained O
its O
`` O
old O
'' O
characteristics O
long O
after O
the O
Old O
Iranian O
languages O
had O
yielded O
to O
their O
Middle O
Iranian O
stage O
. O

Unlike O
Old O
Persian O
, O
which O
has O
Middle O
Persian O
as O
its O
known O
successor O
, O
Avestan O
has O
no O
clearly O
identifiable O
Middle O
Iranian O
stage O
( O
the O
effect O
of O
Middle O
Iranian O
is O
indistinguishable O
from O
effects O
due O
to O
other O
causes O
) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Old O
Persian O
and O
Avestan O
, O
which O
are O
the O
only O
directly O
attested O
Old O
Iranian O
languages O
, O
all O
Middle O
Iranian O
languages O
must O
have O
had O
a O
predecessor O
`` O
Old O
Iranian O
'' O
form O
of O
that O
language O
, O
and O
thus O
can O
all O
be O
said O
to O
have O
had O
an O
( O
at O
least O
hypothetical O
) O
`` O
Old O
'' O
form O
. O

Such O
hypothetical O
Old O
Iranian O
languages O
include O
Carduchi O
( O
the O
hypothetical O
predecessor O
to O
Kurdish B-KP
) O
and O
Old O
Parthian O
. O

Additionally O
, O
the O
existence O
of O
unattested O
languages O
can O
sometimes O
be O
inferred O
from O
the O
impact O
they O
had O
on O
neighbouring O
languages O
. O

Such O
transfer O
is O
known O
to O
have O
occurred O
for O
Old O
Persian O
, O
which O
has O
( O
what O
is O
called O
) O
a O
`` O
Median O
'' O
substrate O
in O
some O
of O
its O
vocabulary O
. O

Also O
, O
foreign O
references O
to O
languages O
can O
also O
provide O
a O
hint O
to O
the O
existence O
of O
otherwise O
unattested O
languages O
, O
for O
example O
through O
toponyms/ethnonyms O
or O
in O
the O
recording O
of O
vocabulary O
, O
as O
Herodotus O
did O
for O
what O
he O
called O
`` O
Scythian B-KP
'' O
. O

Conventionally O
, O
Iranian O
languages O
are O
grouped O
in O
`` O
western O
'' O
and O
`` O
eastern O
'' O
branches O
. O

These O
terms O
have O
little O
meaning O
with O
respect O
to O
Old O
Avestan B-KP
as O
that O
stage O
of O
the O
language O
may O
predate O
the O
settling O
of O
the O
Iranian O
peoples O
into O
western B-KP
and I-KP
eastern I-KP
groups O
. O

The O
geographic O
terms O
also O
have O
little O
meaning O
when O
applied O
to O
Younger O
Avestan O
since O
it O
is O
n't O
known O
where O
that O
dialect O
( O
or O
dialects O
) O
was O
spoken O
either O
. O

Certain O
is O
only O
that O
Avestan O
( O
all O
forms O
) O
and O
Old B-KP
Persian I-KP
are O
distinct O
, O
and O
since O
Old O
Persian O
is O
`` O
western O
'' O
, O
and O
Avestan O
was O
not O
Old O
Persian O
, O
Avestan O
acquired O
a O
default O
assignment O
to O
`` O
eastern O
'' O
. O

Confusing O
the O
issue O
is O

What O
is O
known O
in O
Iranian O
linguistic O
history O
as O
the O
`` O
Middle O
Iranian O
'' O
era O
is O
thought O
to O
begin O
around O
the O
4th O
century O
BCE O
lasting O
through O
the O
9th B-KP
century I-KP
. O

Linguistically O
the O
Middle O
Iranian O
languages O
are O
conventionally O
classified O
into O
two O
main O
groups O
, O
Western B-KP
and I-KP
Eastern I-KP
. O

The O
Western O
family O
includes O
Parthian O
( O
Arsacid O
Pahlavi O
) O
and O
Middle O
Persian O
, O
while O
Bactrian O
, O
Sogdian O
, O
Khwarezmian O
, O
Saka O
, O
and O
Old O
Ossetic O
( O
Scytho O
Sarmatian O
) O
fall O
under O
the O
Eastern B-KP
category O
. O

The O
two O
languages O
of O
the O
Western O
group O
were O
linguistically O
very O
close O
to O
each O
other O
, O
but O
quite O
distinct O
from O
their O
eastern O
counterparts O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
the O
Eastern O
group O
was O
an O
areal O
entity O
whose O
languages O
retained O
some O
similarity O
to O
Avestan B-KP
. O

They O
were O
inscribed O
in O
various O
Aramaic B-KP
derived O
alphabets O
which O
had O
ultimately O
evolved O
from O
the O
Achaemenid O
Imperial O
Aramaic O
script O
, O
though O
Bactrian O
was O
written O
using O
an O
adapted O
Greek B-KP
script I-KP
. O

Middle O
Persian O
( O
Pahlavi B-KP
) O
was O
the O
official O
language O
under O
the O
Sasanian O
dynasty O
in O
Iran O
. O

It O
was O
in O
use O
from O
the O
3rd B-KP
century I-KP
CE I-KP
until O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
10th O
century O
. O

The O
script O
used O
for O
Middle O
Persian O
in O
this O
era O
underwent O
significant O
maturity O
. O

Middle B-KP
Persian I-KP
, I-KP
Parthian I-KP
and I-KP
Sogdian I-KP
were O
also O
used O
as O
literary O
languages O
by O
the O
Manichaeans O
, O
whose O
texts O
also O
survive O
in O
various O
non O
Iranian O
languages O
, O
from O
Latin O
to O
Chinese O
. O

Manichaean O
texts O
were O
written O
in O
a O
script O
closely O
akin O
to O
the O
Syriac B-KP
script I-KP
. O

Following O
the O
Islamic B-KP
Conquest O
of O
Persia O
( O
Iran O
) O
, O
there O
were O
important O
changes O
in O
the O
role O
of O
the O
different O
dialects O
within O
the O
Persian O
Empire O
. O

The O
old O
prestige O
form O
of O
Middle O
Iranian O
, O
also O
known O
as O
Pahlavi O
, O
was O
replaced O
by O
a O
new O
standard O
dialect O
called O
Dari B-KP
as O
the O
official O
language O
of O
the O
court O
. O

The O
name O
Dari O
comes O
from O
the O
word O
darb O
r O
( O
) O
, O
which O
refers O
to O
the O
royal O
court O
, O
where O
many O
of O
the O
poets O
, O
protagonists O
, O
and O
patrons O
of O
the O
literature O
flourished O
. O

The O
Saffarid B-KP
dynasty O
in O
particular O
was O
the O
first O
in O
a O
line O
of O
many O
dynasties O
to O
officially O
adopt O
the O
new O
language O
in O
875 B-KP
CE I-KP
. O

Dari O
may O
have O
been O
heavily O
influenced O
by O
regional O
dialects O
of O
eastern O
Iran O
, O
whereas O
the O
earlier O
Pahlavi O
standard O
was O
based O
more O
on O
western O
dialects O
. O

This O
new O
prestige O
dialect O
became O
the O
basis O
of O
Standard O
New O
Persian O
. O

Medieval O
Iranian O
scholars O
such O
as O
Abdullah O
Ibn O
al O
Muqaffa O
( O
8th O
century O
) O
and O
Ibn O
al O
Nadim O
( O
10th O
century O
) O
associated O
the O
term O
`` O
Dari O
'' O
with O
the O
eastern O
province O
of O
Khorasan B-KP
, O
while O
they O
used O
the O
term O
`` O
Pahlavi O
'' O
to O
describe O
the O
dialects O
of O
the O
northwestern O
areas O
between O
Isfahan O
and O
Azerbaijan O
, O
and O
`` O
P O
rsi O
'' O
( O
`` O
Persian O
'' O
proper O
) O
to O
describe O
the O
Dialects O
of O
Fars O
. O

They O
also O
noted O
that O
the O
unofficial O
language O
of O
the O
royalty O
itself O
was O
yet O
another O
dialect O
, O
`` O
Khuzi O
'' O
, O
associated O
with O
the O
western O
province O
of O
Khuzestan O
. O

The O
Islamic O
conquest O
also O
brought O
with O
it O
the O
adoption O
of O
Arabic B-KP
script I-KP
for O
writing O
Persian O
and O
much O
later O
, O
Kurdish O
, O
Pashto O
and O
Balochi O
. O

All O
three O
were O
adapted O
to O
the O
writing O
by O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
few O
letters O
. O

This O
development O
probably O
occurred O
some O
time O
during O
the O
second B-KP
half I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
8th I-KP
century I-KP
, O
when O
the O
old O
middle O
Persian O
script O
began O
dwindling O
in O
usage O
. O

The O
Arabic O
script O
remains O
in O
use O
in O
contemporary O
modern O
Persian O
. O

Tajik B-KP
script I-KP
was O
first O
Latinised O
in O
the O
1920s O
under O
the O
then O
Soviet O
nationality O
policy O
. O

The O
script O
was O
however O
subsequently O
Cyrillicized O
in O
the B-KP
1930s I-KP
by O
the B-KP
Soviet I-KP
government I-KP
. O

The O
geographical O
regions O
in O
which O

some O
parts O

was O
popular O
at O
one O
period O
of O
time O
because O
it O
was O
much O
easier O
to O
install O
than O
recessed O
lighting O
, O
and O
individual O

are O
decorative O
and O
can O
be O
easily O
aimed O

It O
has O
regained O
some O
popularity O
recently O
in O
low O
voltage O
tracks O
, O
which O
often O
look O
nothing O
like O
their O
predecessors O
because O
they O
do O
not O
have O
the O
safety O
issues O
that O
line O

systems O
have O
, O
and O
are O
therefore O
less O
bulky O
and O
more O
ornamental O
in O
themselves O

Many O
manufactures O
are O
turning O

LED O
headlights O
as O
an O
energy O
efficient O
alternative O
to O
traditional O
headlamps O
. O

Tail O

In O
the O
late B-KP
1950s I-KP
, O
some O
automakers O
began O
to O
use O
electroluminescent O
technology O
to O
backlight O
their O

Commonly O
called O
'light O
bulbs O
' O
, O
lamps O
are O
the O
removable O
and O
replaceable O
part O
of O
a O
light O
fixture O
, O
which O
converts O
electrical B-KP
energy I-KP
into O
electromagnetic O
radiation O
. O

While O
lamps O
have O
traditionally O
been O
rated O
and O
marketed O
primarily O
in O
terms O
of O
their O
power O
consumption O
, O
expressed O
in O
watts O
, O
proliferation O
of O
lighting O
technology O
beyond O
the O
incandescent O
light O
bulb O
has O
eliminated O
the O
correspondence O
of O
wattage O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
light O
produced O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
60 O
W O
incandescent O
light O
bulb O
produces O
about O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
light O
as O
a O
13 O
W O
compact O
fluorescent O
lamp O
. O

Each O
of O
these O
technologies O
has O
a O
different O
efficacy O
in O
converting O
electrical O
energy O
to O
visible O
light O
. O

Visible O
light O
output O
is O
typically O
measured O
in O
lumens O
. O

This O
unit O
only O
quantifies O
the O
visible O
radiation O
, O
and O
excludes O
invisible O
infrared O
and O
ultraviolet O
light O
. O

A O
wax O

, O
and O
a O
15 O

compact O
fluorescent O
lamp O
produces O
about O
800 B-KP

Measurement O
of O
light O
or O
photometry O
is O
generally O
concerned O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
useful O
light O
falling O
on O
a O
surface O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
light O
emerging O
from O
a O

or O
other O
source O
, O
along O
with O
the O
colors O
that O
can O
be O
rendered O
by O
this O

. O

The O
human O
eye O
responds O
differently O
to O
light O
from O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
visible O
spectrum O
, O
therefore O
photometric O
measurements O
must O
take O
the O
luminosity O
function O
into O
account O
when O
measuring O
the O
amount O
of O
useful O
light O
. O

The O
basic O
SI O
unit O
of O
measurement O
is O
the O
candela B-KP
( I-KP
cd I-KP
) I-KP
, O
which O
describes O
the O
luminous O
intensity O
, O
all O
other O
photometric O
units O
are O
derived O
from O
the O
candela O

is O
a O
measure O
of O
the O
density O
of O
luminous O

It O
describes O
the O
amount O

is O
emitted O
from O
a O
particular O
area O
, O
and O
falls O
within O
a O
given O
solid O

. O

The O
SI O
unit O
for O
luminance O
is O
candela O
per O
square O
metre O
( O
cd/m2 B-KP

. O

The O
CGS O
unit O

It O
is O
used O
in O

Typical O
measurements O
of O
light O
have O
used O
a O
Dosimeter O
. O

Dosimeters O
measure O
an O
individual O
's O
or O
an O
object O
's O
exposure O
to O
something O
in O
the O
environment O
, O
such O
as O
light B-KP
dosimeters I-KP
and O
ultraviolet O
dosimeters O
. O

In O
order O
to O
specifically O
measure O
the O
amount O
of O
light O
entering O
the O
eye O
, O
personal O
circadian B-KP
light I-KP
meter I-KP
called O
the O
Daysimeter B-KP
has O
been O
developed O
. O

This O
is O
the O
first O
device O
created O
to O
accurately O
measure O
and O
characterize O
light O
( O
intensity O
, O
spectrum O
, O
timing O
, O
and O
duration O
) O
entering O
the O
eye O
that O
affects O
the O
human O
body O
's O
clock O
. O

The O
small O
, O
head O
mounted O
device O
measures O
an O
individual O
's O
daily O
rest O
and O
activity O
patterns O
, O
as O
well O
as O
exposure O
to O
short B-KP
wavelength I-KP
light I-KP
that O
stimulates O
the O
circadian O
system O
. O

The O
device O
measures O
activity O
and O
light O
together O
at O
regular O
time O
intervals O
and O
electronically O
stores O
and O
logs O
its O
operating O
temperature O

The O
Daysimeter O
can O
gather O

for O
up O
to O
30 B-KP

Specification B-KP
of I-KP
illumination I-KP
requirements I-KP
is O
the O
basic O
concept O
of O
deciding O
how O
much O
illumination O
is O
required O
for O
a O
given O
task O
. O

Clearly O
, O
much O
less O
light O
is O
required O
to O
illuminate O
a O
hallway O
compared O
to O
that O
needed O
for O
a O
word O
processing O
work O
station O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
the O
energy O
expended O
is O
proportional O
to O
the O
design O
illumination O
level O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
lighting O
level O
of O
400 O
lux O
might O
be O
chosen O
for O
a O
work O
environment O
involving O
meeting O
rooms O
and O
conferences O
, O
whereas O
a O
level O
of O
80 O
lux O
could O
be O
selected O
for O
building O
hallways O
. O

If O
the O
hallway O
standard O
simply O
emulates O
the O
conference O
room O
needs O
, O
then O
much O
more O
energy O
will O
be O
consumed O
than O
is O
needed O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
most O
of O
the O
lighting O
standards O
even O
today O
have O
been O
specified O
by O
industrial O
groups O
who O
manufacture O
and O
sell O
lighting O
, O
so O
that O
a O
historical O
commercial O
bias O
exists O
in O
designing O
most O
building O
lighting O
, O
especially O
for O
office O
and O
industrial O
settings O
. O

Lighting B-KP

cost O
by O
helping O
to O
provide O
light O
only O
when O

Some O

also O
support O

will O
automatically O

are O
sometimes O
incorporated O
into O

are O
using O
wireless B-KP

( O
such O
as O
ZigBee B-KP

, O
which O
provides O
benefits O

, O
such O
as O
the O

. O

will O
block O

The O
best O
applications O
for O

are O
open O

with O
a O
clear O

are O
best O
for O
areas O
with O

, O
and O
open O

Some O

utilize O
both O
passive O

and O
ultrasonic O
technology O
, O
but O
are O
usually O
more O
expensive O

They O
can O
be O

Daylighting B-KP
is O
the O
oldest O
method O
of O
interior O
lighting O
. O

Daylighting O
is O
simply O
designing O
a O
space O
to O
use O
as O
much O
natural O
light O
as O
possible O
. O

This O
decreases O
energy O
consumption O
and O
costs O
, O
and O
requires O
less O
heating O
and O
cooling O
from O
the O
building O
. O

Daylighting O
has O
also O
been O
proven O
to O
have O
positive O
effects O
on O
patients O
in O
hospitals O
as O
well O
as O
work O
and O
school O
performance O
. O

Due O
to O
a O
lack O
of O
information O
that O
indicate O
the O
likely O
energy O
savings O
, O
daylighting O
schemes O
are O
not B-KP
yet O
popular O
among O
most O
buildings O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
light O
emitting O
diodes O
( O
LEDs B-KP
) O
are O
becoming O
increasingly O
efficient O
leading O
to O
an O
extraordinary O
increase O
in O
the O
use O
of O
solid O
state O
lighting O
. O

In O
many O
situations O
, O
controlling O
the O
light O
emission O
of O
LEDs O
may O
be O
done O
most O
effectively O
by O
using O
the O
principles O
of O
nonimaging B-KP
optics I-KP
. O

Beyond O
the O
energy O
factors O
being O
considered O
, O
it O
is O
important O
not O
to O
over O

, O
lest O
adverse O
health O
effects O
such O
as O
headache O

, O
and O
increased O

be O
induced O
by O
the O
higher B-KP
lighting I-KP
levels I-KP
. O

In O
addition O
, O
glare O
or O

Analysis O
of O

but O
also O
considers O

. O

Not O
only O
will O
greater O

, O
but O
will O
favorably O
impact O

New O

, O
they O
disrupt B-KP

A O

conducted O
in O
1972 O

, O
surveyed O
23 O
surgical O

The O
study O
concluded O
that O
patients O
assigned O
to O
rooms O
with O
windows O
allowing O
lots O
of O

had O
shorter O
postoperative O

23 O
matched O
patients O
in O
similar O

This O
study O
suggests O
that O
due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O

was O
indeed O
healthier O
for O

at O
the O
University B-KP
of I-KP
Toronto I-KP
Scarborough I-KP
and O
Aparna O
Labroo O
of O
Northwestern B-KP
University I-KP
conducted O
a O
series O
of O
studies O
analyzing O
the O
correlation O
between O
lighting O
and O
human O
emotion O
. O

The O
researchers O
asked O
participants O
to O
rate O
a O
number O
of O
things O
such O
as O
: O
the O
spiciness O
of O
chicken O
wing O
sauce O
, O
the O
aggressiveness O
of O
a O
fictional O
character O
, O
how O
attractive O
someone O
was O
, O
their O
feelings O
about O
specific O
words O
, O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
two O
juices O
all O
under O
different O
lighting O
conditions O
. O

In O
their O
study O
, O
they O
found O
that O
both O
positive O
and O
negative O
human O
emotions O
are O
felt O
more O
intensely O
in O
bright O
light O
. O

Professor O
Xu O
stated O
, O
`` O
we O
found O
that O
on O
sunny O
days O
depression O
prone O
people O
actually O
become O
more O
depressed O
. O
'' O

They O
also O
found O
that O
dim O
light O
makes O
people O
make O
more O
rational O
decisions O
and O
settle O
negotiations O
easier O
. O

In O
the O
dark O
, O
emotions O
are O
slightly O
suppressed O
. O

However O
, O
emotions O
are O
intensified O
in O
the O
bright O
light O
. O

In O
1849 B-KP
, O
Dr. B-KP
Abraham I-KP
Gesner I-KP
, O
a O
Canadian O
geologist O
, O
devised O
a O
method O
where O
kerosene O
could O
be O
distilled O
from O
petroleum O
. O

Earlier O
coal B-KP
gas I-KP
methods I-KP
had O
been O
used O
for O
lighting O
since O
the O
1820s O
, O
but O
they O
were O
expensive O
. O

Gesner O
's O
kerosene O
was O
cheap O
, O
easy O
to O
produce O
, O
could O
be O
burned O
in O
existing O
lamps O
, O
and O
did O
not O
produce O
an O
offensive O
odor O
as O
did O
most O
whale O
oil O
. O

It O
could O
be O
stored O
indefinitely O
, O
unlike O
whale O
oil O
, O
which O
would O
eventually O
spoil O
. O

The O
American O
petroleum O
boom O
began O
in O
the O
1850s O
. O

By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
decade O
there O
were O
30 O
kerosene O
plants O
operating O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O

The O
cheaper O
, O
more O
efficient O
fuel O
began O
to O
drive O
whale O
oil O
out O
of O
the O
market O
. O

John O
D. O
Rockefeller O
was O
most O
responsible O
for O
the O
commercial O
success O
of O
kerosene O
. O

He O
set O
up O
a O
network O
of O
kerosene O
distilleries O
which O
would O
later O
become O
Standard O
Oil O
, O
thus O
completely O
abolishing O
the O
need O
for O
whale O
oil O
lamps O
. O

These O
types O
of O
lamps O
may O
catch O
fire O
or O
emit O
carbon O
monoxide O
and O
sometimes O
are O
odorous O
making O
them O
problematic O
for O
asthmatic O
people O
. O

Compact B-KP
fluorescent I-KP
lamps I-KP
( O
aka O
'CFLs O
' O
) O
use O
less O
power O
to O
supply O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
light O
as O
an O
incandescent O
lamp O
, O
however O
they O
contain O
mercury O
which O
is O
a O
dispose O
hazard O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
ability O
to O
reduce O
electric O
consumption O
, O
many O
organizations O
have O
undertaken O
measures O
to O
encourage O
the O
adoption O
of O
CFLs O
. O

Some O
electric O
utilities O
and O
local O
governments O
have O
subsidized O
CFLs O
or O
provided O
them O
free O
to O
customers O
as O
a O
means O
of O
reducing O
electric O
demand O
. O

For O
a O
given O
light O
output O
, O
CFLs O
use O
between O
one O
fifth O
and O
one O
quarter O
of O
the O
power O
of O
an O
equivalent O
incandescent O
lamp O
. O

One O
of O
the O
simplest O
and O
quickest O
ways O
for O
a O
household O
or O
business O
to O
become O
more O
energy O
efficient O
is O
to O
adopt O
CFLs O
as O
the O
main O
lamp O
source O
, O
as O
suggested O
by O
the O
Alliance O
for O
Climate O
Protection O
. O

Unlike O
incandescent O
lamps O
CFL O
's O
need O
a O
little O
time O
to O
'warm O
up O
' O
and O
reach O
full O
brightness O
. O

Care O
should O
be O
taken O
when O
selecting O
CFL O
's O
because O
not B-KP
all O
of O
them O
are O
suitable O
for O
dimming O
. O

LED O
lamps O
have O
been O
advocated O
as O
the O
newest O
and O
best O
environmental O
lighting O
method O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Energy O
Saving O
Trust O
, O
LED O
lamps O
use O
only O
10 B-KP
% I-KP
power O
compared O
to O
a O
standard O
incandescent O
bulb O
, O
where O
compact O
fluorescent O
lamps O
use O
20 O
% O
and O
energy O
saving O
halogen O
lamps O
70 B-KP
% I-KP
. O

The O
lifetime O
is O
also O
much O
longer O
up O
to O
50,000 B-KP
hours I-KP
. O

A O
downside O
is O
still O
the O
initial O
cost O
, O
which O
is O
higher O
than O
that O
of O
compact O
fluorescent O
lamps O
. O

Light B-KP
pollution I-KP
is O
a O
growing O
problem O
in O
reaction O
to O
excess O
light O
being O
given O
off O
by O
numerous O
signs O
, O
houses O
, O
and O
buildings O
. O

Polluting O
light O
is O
often O
wasted O
light O
involving O
unnecessary O
energy O
costs O
and O
carbon O
dioxide O
emissions O
. O

Light O
pollution O
is O
described O
as O
artificial O
light O
that O
is O
excessive O
or O
intrudes O
where O
it O
is O
not O
wanted O
. O

Well O
designed O
lighting O
sends O
light O
only O
where O
it O
is O
needed O
without O
scattering O
it O
elsewhere O
. O

Poorly O
designed O
lighting O
can O
also O
compromise O
safety O
. O

For O
example O
, O
glare B-KP
creates O
safety O
issues O
around O
buildings O
by O
causing O
very O
sharp O
shadows O
, O
temporarily O
blinding O
passersby O
making O
them O
vulnerable O
to O
would O
be O
assailants O
. O

From O
a O
military O
standpoint O
, O
lighting B-KP
is O
a O
critical O
part O
of O
the O
battlefield O
conditions O
. O

Shadows O
are O
good O
places O
to O
hide O
, O
while O
bright O
areas O
are O
more O
exposed O
. O

It O
is O
often O
beneficial O
to O
fight O
with O
the O
Sun O
or O
other O
light O
source O
behind O
you O
, O
giving O
your O
enemy O
disturbing O
visual O
glare O
and O
partially O
hiding O
your O
own O
movements O
in O
backlight O
. O

If O
natural O
light O
is O
not O
present O
searchlights B-KP
and I-KP
flares I-KP
can O
be O
used O
. O

However O
the O
use O
of O
light O
may O
disclose O
your O
own O
hidden O
position O
and O
modern O
warfare O
have O
seen O
increased O
use O
of O
night O
vision O
through O
the O
use O
of O
infrared B-KP
cameras I-KP
and O
image O
intensifiers O
. O

Flares B-KP
can O
also O
be O
used O
by O
the O
military O
to O
mark O
positions O
, O
usually O
for O
targeting O
, O
but O
laser B-KP

Separation B-KP
of I-KP
powers I-KP
is O
a O
political O
doctrine O
originating O
in O
the O
writings O
of O
Montesquieu O
in O
The O
Spirit O
of O
the O
Laws O
where O
he O
urged O
for O
a O
constitutional O
government O
with O
three B-KP
separate O
branches O
of O
government O
. O

Each O
of O
the O
three O
branches O
would O
have O
defined O
abilities O
to O
check O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
other O
branches O
. O

This O
idea O
was O
called O
separation B-KP
of I-KP
powers I-KP
. O

This O
philosophy O
heavily O
influenced O
the O
writing O
of O
the O
United B-KP
States I-KP
Constitution I-KP
, O
according O
to O
which O
the O
Legislative O
, O
Executive O
, O
and O
Judicial O
branches O
of O
the O
United O
States O
government O
are O
kept O
distinct O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
abuse O
of O
power O
. O

This O
United O
States O
form O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
system O
of O
checks B-KP
and I-KP
balances I-KP
. O

During O
the O
Age O
of O
Enlightenment O
, O
philosophers O
such O
as O
John B-KP
Locke I-KP
advocated O
the O
principle O
in O
their O
writings O
, O
whereas O
others O
, O
such O
as O
Thomas B-KP
Hobbes I-KP
, O
strongly O
opposed O
it O
. O

Montesquieu B-KP
was O
one O
of O
the O
foremost O
supporters O
of O
separating O
the O
legislature O
, O
the O
executive O
, O
and O
the O
judiciary O
. O

His O
writings O
considerably O
influenced O
the O
opinions O
of O
the B-KP
framers I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
United I-KP
States I-KP
Constitution I-KP
. O

Strict O
separation O
of O

did O
not O
operate O
in O
The O
United B-KP
Kingdom I-KP
, O
the O
political O
structure O
of O
which O
served O
in O
most O
instances O
[ O

as O
a O
model O
for O
the O

created O
by O

[ O

Under O
the O
UK B-KP
Westminster O

, O
Parliament O

Sovereign O
( O
King O

, O
House O
of O
Lords O
and O
House O
of O
Commons O
) O
was O
the O
supreme O
lawmaking O
authority O
. O

The O
executive O
branch O
acted O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
King O
( O
`` O
His O
Majesty O
's O
Government O
'' O
) O
, O
as O
did O
the O
judiciary O
. O

The O
King O

Ministers O
were O
in O
most O
cases O
members O
of O
one O
of O
the O
two O
Houses O
of O
Parliament O

the O

One O
minister O

the O
presiding O

Therefore O
, O
it O
may O
be O
seen O
that O
the O
three O
branches O
of O
British O
government O
often O
violated O
the O
strict O
principle O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
, O
even O
though O
there O
were O
many O
occasions O
when O
the O
different O
branches O
of O
the O
government O
disagreed O
with O
each O
other O
. O

Some O
U.S. O
states O
did O
not O
observe O
a O
strict O
separation O
of O
powers O
in O
the O
18th O
century O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
many O
southern O

explicitly O
required O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

Maryland O
, O

all O
kept O
the O

Congress B-KP

the O

doctrine I-KP

In O
this O
vein O
, O
the O

held O
in O
the O
1998 B-KP

that O

does O
not O
make O
great O

sweeping O

the O

was O
contended O

conceded O
that O
the O

a O
legislative O
function O
, O
he O
distinguished O
between O

Marshall O
wrote O
that O

Marshall O

words O
and O
future O

decisions O
gave O
Congress O
much O
latitude O

It O
was O

date O
for O
adjournment O
, O
the O
president O
may O
settle O
the O
dispute O
. O

Either O
house O
or O
both O
houses O
may O
be O
called O
into O
emergency O
session O
by O
the O
president O
. O

The B-KP
Vice I-KP
President I-KP
serves O
as O
president O
of O
the O
Senate O
, O
but O
he O
may O
only O
vote O
to O
break O
a O
tie O
. O

The B-KP
president I-KP
, O
as O
noted O
above O
, O
appoints O
judges O
with O
the O
Senate O
's O
advice O
and O
consent O
. O

He O
also O
has O
the O
power O
to O
issue O
pardons O
and O
reprieves O
. O

Such O
pardons O
are O
not O
subject O
to O
confirmation O
by O
either O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
or O
the O
Senate O
, O
or O
even O
to O
acceptance O
by O
the O
recipient O
. O

The B-KP
president I-KP
is O
the O
civilian O
Commander O
in O
Chief O
of O
the O
Army O
and O
Navy O
of O
the O
United O
States O
. O

He O
has O
the O
authority O
to O
command O
them O
to O
take O
appropriate O
military O
action O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
sudden O
crisis O
. O

However O
, O
only O
the O
Congress B-KP
is O
explicitly O
granted O
the O
power O
to O
declare O
war O
per O
se O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
raise O
, O
fund O
and O
maintain O
the O
armed O
forces O
. O

Congress O
also O
has O
the O
duty O
and O
authority O
to O
prescribe O
the O
laws O
and O
regulations O
under O
which O
the O
armed O
forces O
operate O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Uniform O
Code O
of O
Military O
Justice O
, O
and O
requires O
that O
all O
Generals O
and O
Admirals O
appointed O
by O
the O
president O
be O
confirmed O
by O
a O
majority O
vote O
of O
the B-KP
Senate I-KP
before O
they O
can O
assume O
their O
office O
. O

Courts B-KP
check O
both O
the O
executive O
branch O
and O
the O
legislative O
branch O
through O
judicial O
review O
. O

This O
concept O
is O
not O
written O
into O
the O
Constitution O
, O
but O
was O
envisioned O
by O
many O
of O
the O
Constitution O
's O
Framers O
( O
for O
example O
, O
The O
Federalist O
Papers O
mention O
it O
) O
. O

The O
Supreme O
Court O
established O
a O
precedent O
for O
judicial O
review O
in O
Marbury B-KP
v. I-KP
Madison I-KP
. O

There O
were O
protests O
by O
some O
at O
this O
decision O
, O
born O
chiefly O
of O
political O
expediency O
, O
but O
political O
realities O
in O
the O
particular O
case O
paradoxically O
restrained O
opposing O
views O
from O
asserting O
themselves O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
precedent O
alone O
established O
the O
principle O
that O
a O
court O
may O
strike O
down O
a O
law O
it O
deems O
unconstitutional O
. O

A O
common O
misperception O
is O
that O
the B-KP
Supreme I-KP
Court I-KP
is O
the O
only O
court O
that O
may O
determine O
constitutionality O
; O
the O
power O
is O
exercised O
even O
by O
the O
inferior O
courts O
. O

But O
only O
Supreme O
Court O
decisions O
are O
binding O
across O
the O
nation O
. O

Decisions O
of O
a O
Court O
of O
Appeals O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
are O
binding O
only O
in O
the O
circuit O
over O
which O
the O
court O
has O
jurisdiction O
. O

The O
power O
to O
review O
the O
constitutionality O
of O
laws O
may O
be O
limited O
by O
Congress B-KP
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
set O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
courts O
. O

The O
only O
constitutional O
limit O
on O
Congress O
' O
power O
to O
set O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
judiciary O
relates O
to O
the B-KP
Supreme I-KP
Court I-KP
; O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
may O
exercise O
only O
appellate O
jurisdiction O
except O
in O
cases O
involving O
states O
and O
cases O
affecting O
foreign O
ambassadors O
, O
ministers O
or O
consuls O
. O

The B-KP
Chief I-KP
Justice I-KP
presides O
in O
the O
Senate O
during O
a O
president O
's O
impeachment O
trial O
. O

The O
rules O
of O
the O
Senate O
, O
however O
, O
generally O
do O
not O
grant O
much O
authority O
to O
the O
presiding O
officer O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
Chief O
Justice O
's O
role O
in O
this O
regard O
is O
a O
limited O
one O
. O

The O
Constitution O
does O
not O
explicitly O
indicate O
the O
pre O
eminence O
of O
any O
particular O
branch O
of O
government O
. O

However O
, O
James B-KP
Madison I-KP
wrote O
in O
Federalist B-KP
51 I-KP
, O
regarding O
the O
ability O
of O
each O
branch O
to O
defend O
itself O
from O
actions O
by O
the O
others O
, O
that O
`` O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
give O
to O
each O
department O
an O
equal O
power O
of O
self O
defense O
. O

In O
republican O
government O
, O
the O
legislative O
authority O
necessarily O
predominates O
. O
'' O

Throughout O
America O
's O
history O
dominance O
of O
one O
of O
the O
three O
branches O
has O
essentially O
been O
a O
see O
saw O
struggle O
between O
Congress B-KP
and O
the O
president O
. O

Both O
have O
had O
periods O
of O
great O
power O
and O
weakness O
such O
as O
immediately O
after O
the O
Civil O
War O
when O
republicans O
had O
a O
majority O
in O
Congress O
and O
were O
able O
to O
pass O
major O
legislation O
and O
shoot O
down O
most O
of O
the O
president O
's O
vetoes O
. O

They O
also O
passed O
acts O
to O
essentially O
make O
the O
president O
subordinate O
to O
Congress O
, O
such O
as O
the O
Tenure O
of O
Office O
Act O
. O

Johnson O
's O
later O
impeachment O
also O
cost O
the O
presidency O
much O
political O
power O
. O

However O
the O
president O
has O
also O
exercised O
greater O
power O
largely O
during O
the O
20th O
century O
. O

Both O
Roosevelts O
greatly O
expanded O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
president O
and O
wielded O
great O
power O
during O
their O
terms O
. O

The O
first O
six O
presidents O
of O
the O
United O
States O
did O
not O
make O
extensive O
use O
of O
the O
veto O
power O
: O
George O
Washington O
only O
vetoed O
two B-KP
bills O
, O
James O
Monroe O
one B-KP
, O
and O
John O
Adams O
, O
Thomas O
Jefferson O
and O
John O
Quincy O
Adams O
none O
. O

James O
Madison O
, O
a O
firm O
believer O
in O
a O
strong O
executive O
, O
vetoed O
seven O
bills O
. O

None O
of O
the O
first O
six O
Presidents O
, O
however O
, O
used O
the O
veto O
to O
direct O
national O
policy O
. O

It O
was O
Andrew B-KP
Jackson I-KP
, O
the O
seventh O
President O
, O
who O
was O
the O
first O
to O
use O
the O
veto O
as O
a O
political O
weapon O
. O

During O
his O
two O
terms O
in O
office O
, O
he O
vetoed O
twelve B-KP
bills O
more O
than O
all O
of O
his O
predecessors O
combined O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
he O
defied O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
in O
enforcing O
the O
policy O
of O
ethnically O
cleansing O
Native O
American O
tribes O
( O
`` O
Indian O
Removal O
'' O
) O
; O
he O
stated O
( O
perhaps O
apocryphally O
) O
, O
`` O
John O
Marshall O
has O
made O
his O
decision O
. O

Now O
let O
him O
enforce O
it O
! O
'' O

Some O
of O
Jackson O
's O
successors O
made O
no O
use O
of O
the O
veto O
power O
, O
while O
others O
used O
it O
intermittently O
. O

It O
was O
only O
after O
the O
Civil O
War O
that O
presidents O
began O
to O
use O
the O
power O
to O
truly O
counterbalance O
Congress O
. O

Andrew O
Johnson O
, O
a O
Democrat O
, O
vetoed O
several O
Reconstruction O
bills O
passed O
by O
the O
`` O
Radical O
Republicans O
. O
'' O

Congress O
, O
however O
, O
managed O
to O
override O
fifteen B-KP
of O
Johnson O
's O
twenty O
nine O
vetoes O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
attempted O
to O
curb O
the O
power O
of O
the O
presidency O
by O
passing O
the O
Tenure B-KP
of I-KP
Office I-KP
Act I-KP
. O

The O
Act O
required O
Senate O
approval O
for O
the O
dismissal O
of O
senior O
Cabinet O
officials O
. O

When O
Johnson O
deliberately O
violated O
the O
Act O
, O
which O
he O
felt O
was O
unconstitutional O
( O
Supreme O
Court O
decisions O
later O
vindicated O
such O
a O
position O
) O
, O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
impeached O
him O
; O
he O
was O
acquitted O
in O
the O
Senate O
by O
one O
vote O
. O

Johnson O
's O
impeachment O
was O
perceived O
to O
have O
done O
great O
damage O
to O
the O
presidency O
, O
which O
came O
to O
be O
almost O
subordinate O
to O
Congress O
. O

Some O
believed O
that O
the O
president O
would O
become O
a O
mere O
figurehead O
, O
with O
the O
Speaker O
of O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
becoming O
a O
de O
facto O
Prime O
Minister O
. O

Grover B-KP
Cleveland I-KP
, O
the O
first O
Democratic O
President O
following O
Johnson O
, O
attempted O
to O
restore O
the O
power O
of O
his O
office O
. O

During O
his O
first O
term O
, O
he O
vetoed O
over O
four O
hundred O
bills O
twice O
as O
many O
bills O
as O
his O
twenty O
one O
predecessors O
combined O
. O

He O
also O
began O
to O
suspend O
bureaucrats O
who O
were O
appointed O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
patronage O
system O
, O
replacing O
them O
with O
more O
`` O
deserving O
'' O
individuals O
. O

The O
Senate O
, O
however O
, O
refused O
to O
confirm O
many O
new O
nominations O
, O
instead O
demanding O
that O
Cleveland O
turn O
over O
the O
confidential O
records O
relating O
to O
the O
suspensions O
. O

Cleveland O
steadfastly O
refused O
, O
asserting O
, O
`` O
These O
suspensions O
are O
my O
executive O
acts O
... O

I O
am O
not O
responsible O
to O
the O
Senate O
, O
and O
I O
am O
unwilling O
to O
submit O
my O
actions O
to O
them O
for O
judgment O
. O
'' O

Cleveland O
's O
popular O
support O
forced O
the O
Senate O
to O
back O
down O
and O
confirm O
the O
nominees O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Congress O
finally O
repealed O
the O
controversial O
Tenure O
of O
Office O
Act O
that O
had O
been O
passed O
during O
the O
Johnson O
Administration O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
meant O
that O
Cleveland O
's O
Administration O
marked O
the O
end O
of O
presidential O
subordination O
. O

Several O
twentieth O
century O
presidents O
have O
attempted O
to O
greatly O
expand O
the O
power O
of O
the O
presidency O
. O

Theodore O
Roosevelt O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
claimed O
that O
the O
president O
was O
permitted O
to O
do O
whatever O
was O
not O
explicitly O
prohibited O
by O
the O
law O
in O
direct O
contrast O
to O
his O
immediate O
successor O
, O
William O
Howard O
Taft O
. O

Franklin O
Delano O
Roosevelt O
held O
considerable O
power O
during O
the O
Great O
Depression O
. O

Congress B-KP
had O
granted O
Franklin B-KP
Roosevelt I-KP
sweeping O
authority O
; O
in O
Panama O
Refining O
v. O
Ryan O
, O
the O
Court O
for O
the O
first O
time O
struck O
down O
a O
Congressional O
delegation O
of O
power O
as O
violative O
of O
the O
doctrine O
of O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

The O
aforementioned O
Schechter O
Poultry O
Corp. O
v. O
United O
States O
, O
another O
separation O
of O
powers O
case O
, O
was O
also O
decided O
during O
Franklin O
Roosevelt O
's O
presidency O
. O

In O
response O
to O
many O
unfavorable O
Supreme O
Court O
decisions O
, O
Roosevelt O
introduced O
a O
`` O
Court O
Packing O
'' O
plan O
, O
under O
which O
more O
seats O
would O
be O
added O
to O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
for O
the O
president O
to O
fill O
. O

Such O
a O
plan O
( O
which O
was O
defeated O
in O
Congress O
) O
would O
have O
seriously O
undermined O
the O
judiciary O
's O
independence O
and O
power O
. O

Richard O
Nixon O
used O
national B-KP
security I-KP
as O
a O
basis O
for O
his O
expansion O
of O
power O
. O

He O
asserted O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
`` O
the O
inherent O
power O
of O
the O
President O
to O
safeguard O
the O
security O
of O
the O
nation O
'' O
authorized O
him O
to O
order O
a O
wiretap O
without O
a O
judge O
's O
warrant O
. O

Nixon O
also O
asserted O
that O
`` O
executive O
privilege O
'' O
shielded O
him O
from O
all O
legislative O
oversight O
; O
furthermore O
, O
he O
impounded O
federal O
funds O
( O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
he O
refused O
to O
spend O
money O
that O
Congress O
had O
appropriated O
for O
government O
programs O
) O
. O

In O
the O
specific O
cases O
aforementioned O
, O
however O
, O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
ruled O
against O
Nixon O
. O

This O
was O
also O
because O
of O
an O
ongoing O
criminal O
investigation O
into O
the O
Watergate O
tapes O
, O
even O
though O
they O
acknowledged O
the O
general O
need O
for O
executive O
privilege O
. O

Since O
then O
, O
Nixon O
's O
successors O
have O
sometimes O
asserted O
that O
they O
may O
act O
in O
the O
interests O
of O
national O
security O
or O
that O
executive O
privilege O
shields O
them O
from O
Congressional O
oversight O
. O

Though O
such O
claims O
have O
in O
general O
been O
more O
limited O
than O
Nixon O
's O
, O
one O
may O
still O
conclude O
that O
the O
presidency O
's O
power O
has O
been O
greatly O
augmented O
since O
the O
eighteenth O
and O
nineteenth O
centuries O
. O

It O
is O
said O
[ O
by O
whom O
? O
] O

on O
one O
side O
of O
this O
debate O
that O
separation O
of O
powers O
means O
that O
powers O
are O
shared O
among O
different O
branches O
; O
no O
one O
branch O
may O
act O
unilaterally O
on O
issues O
( O
other O
than O
perhaps O
minor O
questions O
) O
, O
but O
must O
obtain O
some O
form O
of O
agreement O
across O
branches O
. O

That O
is O
, O
it O
is O
argued O
that O
`` O
checks B-KP
and I-KP
balances I-KP
'' O
apply O
to O
the O
Judicial O
branch O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
other O
branches O
. O

An O
example O
of O
the O
first O
view O
is O
the O
regulation O
of O
attorneys O
and O
judges O
, O
and O
the O
establishment O
of O
rules O
for O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
courts O
, O
by O
the O
Congress O
and O
in O
the O
states O
the O
legislatures O
. O

Although O
in O
practice O
these O
matters O
are O
delegated O
to O
the B-KP
Supreme I-KP
Court I-KP
, O
the O
Congress O
holds O
these O
powers O
and O
delegates O
them O
to O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
only O
for O
convenience O
in O
light O
of O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
's O
expertise O
, O
but O
can O
withdraw O
that O
delegation O
at O
any O
time O
. O

An O
example O
of O
the O
second O
view O
at O
the O
State O
level O
is O
found O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the B-KP
Florida I-KP
Supreme I-KP
Court I-KP
, O
that O
only O
the O
Florida O
Supreme O
Court O
may O
license O
and O
regulate O
attorneys O
appearing O
before O
the O
courts O
of O
Florida O
, O
and O
only O
the O
Florida O
Supreme O
Court O
may O
set O
rules O
for O
procedures O
in O
the O
Florida O
courts O

primarily O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
proportion B-KP
, O
although O
ornament O
also O
played O
a O
part O

For O
Alberti O
, O
the O
rules O
of O

were O
those O
that O
governed O
the O
idealised O
human O
figure O
, O
the B-KP

The O
most O
important O
aspect O
of O
beauty O
was O
therefore O
an O
inherent O
part O
of O
an O
object O
, O
rather O
than O
something O
applied O
superficially O
; O

was O
based O
on O
universal O

The O
notion O
of O

was O
not O
developed O
until O

1849 B-KP
, O
was O
much O
narrower O
in O
his O
view O

what O

Architecture O
was O
the O
`` O

For O
Ruskin O
, O
the B-KP
aesthetic I-KP
was O
of O
overriding O
significance O

His O
work O
goes O
on O

state O
that O

it B-KP

For O
Ruskin O

While O
the O

that O

was O
met O
with O
both B-KP

on O
revivalist O
architecture O
and O
elaborate O
decoration O
gave O
rise O
to O
many O
new O
lines O
of O
thought O
that O
served O
as O
precursors O
to O
Modern B-KP
Architecture I-KP
. O

Notable O
among O
these O
is O
the O
Deutscher O
Werkbund O
, O
formed O
in O
1907 B-KP
to B-KP
produce I-KP
better I-KP
quality I-KP
machine I-KP
made I-KP
objects I-KP
. O

The O
rise O
of O
the O
profession O
of O
industrial O
design O
is O
usually O
placed O
here O
. O

Following O
this O
lead O
, O
the B-KP
Bauhaus I-KP
school I-KP
, O
founded O
in O
Weimar O
, O
Germany O
in O
1919 O
, O
redefined O
the O
architectural O
bounds O
prior O
set O
throughout O
history O
, O
viewing O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
building O
as O
the O
ultimate O
synthesis O
the O
apex O
of O
art O
, O
craft O
, O
and O
technology O
. O

When O
modern O
architecture O
was O
first O
practiced O
, O
it O
was O
an O
avant B-KP
garde I-KP
movement I-KP
with O
moral O
, O
philosophical O
, O
and O
aesthetic O
underpinnings O
. O

Immediately O
after O
World O
War O
I O
, O
pioneering O
modernist O
architects O
sought O
to O
develop O
a O
completely O
new O
style O
appropriate O
for O
a O
new O
post O
war O
social O
and O
economic O
order O
, O
focused O
on O
meeting O
the O
needs O
of O
the B-KP
middle I-KP
and I-KP
working I-KP
classes I-KP
. O

They O
rejected O
the O
architectural O
practice O
of O
the O
academic O
refinement O
of O
historical O
styles O
which O
served O
the B-KP
rapidly I-KP
declining I-KP
aristocratic I-KP
order I-KP
. O

The O
approach O
of O
the O
Modernist O
architects O
was O
to O
reduce O
buildings O
to O
pure O
forms O
, O
removing O
historical B-KP
references I-KP
and I-KP
ornament I-KP
in O
favor O
of O
functionalist B-KP
details O
. O

Buildings O
displayed O
their O
functional O
and O
structural O
elements O
, O
exposing O
steel O
beams O
and O
concrete O
surfaces O
instead O
of O
hiding O
them O
behind O
decorative O
forms O
. O

Architects O
such O
as O
Frank B-KP
Lloyd I-KP
Wright I-KP
developed O
Organic O
architecture O
, O
in O
which O
the O
form O
was O
defined O
by O
its O
environment O
and O
purpose O
, O
with O
an O
aim O
to B-KP
promote I-KP
harmony I-KP
between O
human O
habitation O
and O
the O
natural O
world O
with O
prime O
examples O
being O
Robie B-KP
House I-KP
and I-KP
Fallingwater I-KP
. O

Architects O
such O
as O
Mies O
van O
der O
Rohe O
, O
Philip O
Johnson O
and O
Marcel O
Breuer O
worked O
to O
create O
beauty O
based O
on O
the O
inherent O
qualities O
of O
building O
materials O
and O
modern O
construction O
techniques O
, O
trading O
traditional O
historic O
forms O
for O
simplified O
geometric O
forms O
, O
celebrating O
the O
new O
means O
and O
methods O
made O
possible O
by O
the B-KP
Industrial I-KP
Revolution I-KP
, O
including O
steel B-KP
frame I-KP
construction I-KP
, O
which O
gave O
birth O
to O
high O
rise O
superstructures O
. O

By O
mid O
century O
, O
Modernism O
had O
morphed O
into O
the O
International B-KP
Style I-KP
, O
an O
aesthetic O
epitomized O
in O
many O
ways O
by O
the O
Twin B-KP
Towers I-KP
of O
New O
York O
's O
World O
Trade O
Center O
designed O
by O
Minoru B-KP
Yamasaki I-KP
. O

Many O
architects O
resisted O
modernism O
, O
finding O
it O
devoid O
of O
the O
decorative B-KP
richness I-KP
of O
historical O
styles O
. O

As O
the O
first O
generation O
of O
modernists O
began O
to O
die O
after O
WWII O
, O
a O
second O
generation O
of O
architects O
including O
Paul B-KP
Rudolph I-KP
, I-KP
Marcel I-KP
Breuer I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
Eero I-KP
Saarinen I-KP
tried O
to O
expand O
the O
aesthetics O
of O
modernism O
with O
Brutalism O
, O
buildings O
with O
expressive O
sculptural O
facades O
made O
of O
unfinished B-KP
concrete I-KP
. O

But O
an O
even O
new O
younger O
postwar B-KP
generation I-KP
critiqued O
modernism O
and O
Brutalism O
for O
being O
too O
austere O
, O
standardized O
, O
monotone O
, O
and O
not O
taking O
into O
account O
the O
richness O
of O
human O
experience O
offered O
in O
historical O
buildings O
across O
time O
and O
in O
different O
places O
and O
cultures O
. O

One O
such O
reaction O
to O
the O
cold O
aesthetic O
of O
modernism O
and O
Brutalism O
is O
the B-KP
school I-KP
of I-KP
metaphoric I-KP
architecture I-KP
, O
which O
includes O
such O
things O
as O
biomorphism B-KP
and I-KP
zoomorphic I-KP
architecture I-KP
, O
both O
using O
nature B-KP
as O
the O
primary O
source O
of O
inspiration O
and O
design O
. O

While O
it O
is O
considered O
by O
some O
to O
be O
merely O
an O
aspect O
of O
postmodernism O
, O
others O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
school O
in O
its O
own O
right O
and O
a O
later O
development O
of O
expressionist B-KP
architecture I-KP
. O

Beginning O
in O
the B-KP
late I-KP
1950s I-KP
and I-KP
1960s I-KP
, O
architectural O
phenomenology O
emerged O
as O
an O
important O
movement O
in O
the O
early O
reaction O
against O
modernism B-KP
, O
with O
architects O
like O
Charles O
Moore O
in O
the O
USA O
, O
Christian O
Norberg O
Schulz O
in O
Norway O
, O
and O
Ernesto O
Nathan O
Rogers O
and O
Vittorio O
Gregotti O
in O
Italy O
, O
who O
collectively O
popularized O
an O
interest O
in O
a O
new O
contemporary O
architecture O
aimed O
at O
expanding O
human B-KP
experience I-KP
using O
historical O
buildings O
as O
models O
and O
precedents O
. O

Postmodernism O
produced O
a O
style O
that O
combined O
contemporary O
building O
technology O
and O
cheap O
materials O
, O
with O
the O
aesthetics O
of O
older O
pre O
modern O
and O
non O
modern O
styles O
, O
from O
high O
classical O
architecture O
to O
popular O
or O
vernacular O
regional O
building O
styles O
. O

Robert B-KP
Venturi I-KP
famously O
defined O
postmodern O
architecture O
as O
a O
`` O
decorated O
shed O
'' O
( O
an O
ordinary O
building O
which O
is O
functionally O
designed O
inside O
and O
embellished O
on O
the O
outside O
) O
, O
and O
upheld O
it O
against O
modernist O
and O
brutalist O
`` O
ducks O
'' O
( O
buildings O
with O
unnecessarily O
expressive O
tectonic O
forms O
) O
. O

Since B-KP
the I-KP
1980s I-KP
, O
as O
the O
complexity O
of O
buildings O
began O
to O
increase O
( O
in O
terms O
of O
structural O
systems O
, O
services O
, O
energy O
and O
technologies O
) O
, O
the O
field O
of O
architecture O
became O
multi O
disciplinary O
with O
specializations O
for O
each O
project O
type O
, O
technological O
expertise O
or O
project O
delivery O
methods O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
has O
been O
an O
increased O
separation O
of O
the O
'design O
' O
architect O
[ O
Notes O

] O
from O
the O
'project O
' O
architect O
who O
ensures O
that O
the O
project O
meets O
the O
required O
standards O
and O
deals O
with O
matters O
of O

. O

[ O
Notes O

] O
The O
preparatory O
processes O
for O
the O
design O
of O
any O
large O
building O
have O
become O
increasingly O
complicated O
, O
and O
require O
preliminary O
studies O
of O
such O
matters O
as O
durability O
, O
sustainability O
, O
quality O
, O
money O
, O
and O
compliance O
with O
local O
laws O
. O

A O
large O
structure O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
the O
design O
of O
one B-KP
person I-KP
but O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
many O

Modernism B-KP
and I-KP
Postmodernism I-KP
have O
been O
criticised O
by O
some O
members O
of O
the O
architectural O
profession O
who O
feel O
that O
successful O
architecture O
is O
not O
a O
personal O
, O
philosophical O
, O
or O
aesthetic O
pursuit O
by O
individualists O
; O
rather O
it O
has O
to O
consider O
everyday O
needs O
of O
people O
and O
use O
technology O
to O
create O
liveable O
environments O
, O
with O
the O

being O
informed O
by O
studies O
of O
behavioral O

Environmental B-KP
sustainability I-KP
has O
become O
a O
mainstream O
issue O
, O
with O
profound O
effect O
on O
the O
architectural O
profession O
. O

Many O
developers O
, O
those O
who O
support O
the O
financing O
of O
buildings O
, O
have O
become O
educated O
to O
encourage O
the O
facilitation O
of O
environmentally O
sustainable O
design O
, O
rather O
than O
solutions O
based O
primarily O
on O

Major O
examples O

this O
can O
be O
found O
in O
Passive O

greener O

, O
biodegradable O

, O
and O
more O
attention O
to O
a O

. O

This O
major O
shift O
in O
architecture O
has O
also O
changed O
architecture O
schools O
to O
focus O
more O
on O
the B-KP
environment I-KP
. O

Sustainability O
in O
architecture O
was O
pioneered O
by O
Frank B-KP

in O
the O
1960s O
by O
Buckminster B-KP

acceleration O

the O
number O

Gustav O

of I-KP

and O
had O
served O
in O
World O

after O
voluntarily O
joining O
the O
Nazi O

years O
old O

According O
to O
Schwarzenegger O
, O
both O
of O
his O
parents O
were O
very O
strict O
: O
`` O
Back O
then O
in O
Austria O
it O
was O
a O
very O
different O
world O
, O
if O
we O
did O
something O
bad O
or O
we O
disobeyed O
our O
parents O
, O
the O
rod O
was O
not O
spared O

'' O

He O
grew O
up O
in O
a O
Roman O
Catholic O
family O
who O
attended O
Mass O
every O
Sunday O
. O

Gustav O
had O
a O
preference O
for O
his O
elder O
son O
, O
Meinhard B-KP
( O
July O
17 O
, O
1946 O
May O
20 O
, O
1971 O
) O
, O
over O
Arnold O
. O

His O
favoritism O
was O
`` O
strong O
and O
blatant O
, O
'' O
which O
stemmed O
from O
unfounded O
suspicion O
that O
Arnold O
was O
not O
his O
biological O
child O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
has O
said O
his O
father O
had O
`` O
no O
patience O
for O
listening O
or O
understanding O
your O
problems O

'' O

Schwarzenegger O
had O
a O
good O
relationship O
with O
his O
mother O
and O
kept O
in O
touch O
with O
her O
until O
her O
death O
. O

In O
later O
life O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
commissioned O
the O
Simon O
Wiesenthal O
Center O
to O
research O
his O
father O
's O
wartime O
record O
, O
which O
came O
up O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
Gustav O
's O
being O
involved O
in O
atrocities O
, O
despite O
Gustav O
's O
membership O
in O
the O
Nazi O
Party O
and O
SA O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
's O
father O
's O
background O
received O
wide O
press O
attention O
during O
the O
2003 O
California O
recall O
campaign O
. O

At O
school O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
was O
apparently O
in O
the O
middle O
but O
stood O
out O
for O
his O
`` O
cheerful O
, O
good O
humored O
and O
exuberant O
'' O
character O
. O

Money O
was O
a O
problem O
in O
their O
household O
; O
Schwarzenegger O
recalled O
that O
one O
of O
the O
highlights O
of O
his O
youth O
was O
when O
the O
family O
bought O
a O
refrigerator B-KP
. O

As O
a O
boy O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
played O
several O
sports O
, O
heavily O
influenced O
by O
his O
father O
. O

He O
picked O
up O
his O
first O
barbell O
in O
1960 O
, O
when O
his O
soccer B-KP
coach O
took O
his O
team O
to O
a O
local O
gym O
. O

At O
the O
age O
of O
14 O
, O
he O
chose O
bodybuilding O
over O
soccer O
as O
a O
career O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
has O
responded O
to O
a O
question O
asking O
if O
he O
was O
13 O
when O
he O
started O
weightlifting O
: O
`` O
I O
actually O
started O
weight O
training O
when O
I O
was O
15 O
, O
but O
I O
'd O
been O
participating O
in O
sports O
, O
like O
soccer O
, O
for O
years O
, O
so O
I O
felt O
that O
although O
I O
was O
slim O
, O
I O
was O
well O
developed O
, O
at O
least O
enough O
so O
that O
I O
could O
start O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
and O
start O
Olympic O
lifting O
. O
'' O

However O
, O
his O
official O
website O
biography O
claims O
: O
`` O
At O
14 O
, O
he O
started O
an O
intensive O
training O
program O
with O
Dan O
Farmer O
, O
studied O
psychology O
at O
15 O
( O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
the O
power O
of O
mind O
over O
body O
) O
and O
at O
17 O
, O
officially O
started O
his O
competitive O
career O
. O
'' O

During O
a O
speech O
in O
2001 O
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
My O
own O
plan O
formed O
when O
I O
was O
14 O
years O
old O
. O

My O
father O
had O
wanted O
me O
to O
be O
a O
police B-KP
officer I-KP
like O
he O
was O
. O

My O
mother O
wanted O
me O
to O
go O
to O
trade O

'' O

Schwarzenegger O
took O
to O
visiting O
a O
gym O
in O
Graz O
, O
where O
he O
also O
frequented O
the O
local O

to O
see O

as O
Reg O
Park O
, O
Steve B-KP
Reeves I-KP

and O
Johnny O

on O
the O
big O

. O

When O
Reeves O
died O
in O
2000 O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
fondly O
remembered O
him O
: O
`` O
As O
a O
teenager O
, O
I O
grew O
up O
with O
Steve O
Reeves O
. O

His O
remarkable O
accomplishments O
allowed O
me O
a O
sense O
of O
what O
was O
possible O
, O
when O
others O
around O
me O
did O
n't O
always O
understand O
my O
dreams O

Steve O
Reeves O
has O
been O
part O
of O
everything O
I O
've O
ever O
been O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
achieve O
. O
'' O

In O
1961 O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
met O
former O
Mr. O
Austria O
Kurt O
Marnul O
, O
who O
invited O
him O
to O
train O
at O
the O
gym O
in O
Graz O
. O

He O
was O
so O
dedicated O
as O
a O
youngster O
that O
he O
broke O
into O
the O
local O
gym O
on O
weekends O
, O
when O
it O
was O
usually O
closed O
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
train O
. O

`` O
It O
would O
make O
me O
sick O

miss O

I O
knew O

When O
Schwarzenegger O
was O
asked O
about O
his O
first O
movie O
experience O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
he O
replied O
: O
`` O
I O

young O

of O
his O

without O

that O
he O
never O

Over O

he O

given O
at O

three O

of O
why O
he O
was O
absent O
from O

In O
an O

, O
Schwarzenegger O
told O
how O
he O
suffered O
what O
`` O
would O
now O
be O
called O
child O

'' O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
his O

: O
`` O
My O
hair O
was O
pulled O

I O
was O
hit O

So O
was O
the O

It O
was O
just O
the O
way O
it O

Many O
of O
the O
children O
I O
've O
seen O
were O
broken O
by O
their O

which O
was O
the O
German O
Austrian O

They O
did O
n't O
want O

create O
an O

It O
was O
all O
about O

I O
was O
one O
who O
did O
not O

and O
whose O
will O
could O
not O

Therefore O
, O
I O
became O

every O

Schwarzenegger O
was O

under O
the O
second O

on O
the O

with O
48.6 O
% O

Schwarzenegger O
defeated O

fellow O

and O
others O
. O

His O
nearest O

received O
31 B-KP

In O
total O

Schwarzenegger O
won O

. O

Under O
the O
regulations O
of O
the O
California O
Constitution O
, O
no O
runoff O
election O
was O
required O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
was O
the O
second O
foreign O
born O
governor O
of O
California O
after O
Irish O
born O
Governor O
John B-KP
G. I-KP
Downey I-KP
in O
1862 O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
Schwarzenegger O
was O
elected O
governor O
, O
Willie B-KP
Brown I-KP
said O
he O
would O
start O
a O
drive O
to O
recall O
the O
governor O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
was O
equally O
entrenched O
in O
what O
he O
considered O
to O
be O
his O
mandate O
in O
cleaning O
up O
gridlock O
. O

Building O
on O
a O
catchphrase O
from O
the O
sketch O
`` O
Hans B-KP
and I-KP
Franz I-KP
'' O
from O
Saturday O
Night O
Live O
( O
which O
partly O
parodied O
his O
bodybuilding O
career O
) O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
called O
the O
Democratic O
State O
politicians O
`` O
girlie O
men O
'' O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
's O
early O
victories O
included O
repealing O
an O
unpopular O
increase O
in O
the O
vehicle O
registration O
fee O
as O
well O
as O
preventing O
driver O
's O
licenses O
being O
given O
out O
to O
illegal O
immigrants O
, O
but O
later O
he O
began O
to O
feel O
the O
backlash O
when O
powerful O
state O
unions O
began O
to O
oppose O
his O
various O
initiatives O
. O

Key O
among O
his O
reckoning O
with O
political O
realities O
was O
a O
special O
election O
he O
called O
in O
November B-KP
2005 O
, O
in O
which O
four B-KP
ballot O
measures O
he O
sponsored O
were O
defeated O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
accepted O
personal O
responsibility O
for O
the O
defeats O
and O
vowed O
to O
continue O
to O
seek O
consensus O
for O
the O
people O
of O
California O
. O

He O
would O
later O
comment O
that O
`` O
no O
one O
could O
win O
if O
the O
opposition O
raised O
160 O
million O
dollars O
to O
defeat O
you O
'' O
. O

The O
U.S. O
Supreme O
Court O
later O
found O
the O
public O
employee O

use O
of O
compulsory O
fundraising O
during O
the O
campaign O
had O
been O
illegal O
in O
Knox O
v. O
Service O
Employees O
International O
Union O
, O
Local O
1000 O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
then O
went O
against O
the O
advice O
of O
fellow O
Republican O
strategists O
and O
appointed O
a O
Democrat O
, O
Susan B-KP
Kennedy I-KP
, O
as O
his O
Chief O
of O
Staff O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
gradually O
moved O
towards O
a O
more O
politically O
moderate O
position O
, O
determined O
to O
build O
a O
winning O
legacy O
with O
only O
a O
short O
time O
to O
go O
until O
the O
next O
gubernatorial O
election O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
ran O
for O
re O
election O
against O
Democrat O
Phil B-KP
Angelides I-KP
, O
the O
California O
State O
Treasurer O
, O
in O
the O
2006 O
elections O
, O
held O
on O
November O
7 O
, O
2006 O
. O

Despite O
a O
poor O
year O
nationally O
for O
the O
Republican O
party O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
won O
re O
election O
with O
56.0 O
% O
of O
the O
vote O
compared O
with O
38.9 O
% O
for O
Angelides O
, O
a O
margin O
of O
well O
over O
one O
million O
votes O
. O

In O
recent O
years O
, O
many O
commentators O
have O
seen O
Schwarzenegger O
as O
moving O
away O
from O
the O
right O
and O
towards O
the O
center O
of O
the O
political O
spectrum O
. O

After O
hearing O
a O
speech O
by O
Schwarzenegger O
at O
the O
2006 O
Martin O
Luther O
King O
, O
Jr. O
breakfast O
, O
San B-KP
Francisco I-KP
mayor O
Gavin O

said O
that O
, O
`` O

not O
even O
to O
the O

I O
would O
say O
center O
left O
'' O
. O

It O
was O
rumored O
that O
Schwarzenegger O
might O
run O
for O
the O
United B-KP
States I-KP
Senate I-KP
in O
2010 O
, O
as O
his O
governorship O
would O
be O
term O
limited O
by O
that O
time O

This O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
false O
. O

Wendy B-KP
Leigh I-KP
, O
who O
wrote O
an O
unofficial O
biography O
on O
Schwarzenegger O
, O
claims O
he O
plotted O
his O
political O
rise O
from O
an O
early O
age O
using O
the O
movie O
business O
and O
bodybuilding O
as O
building O
blocks O
to O
escape O
a O
depressing O
home O
. O

Leigh O
portrays O
Schwarzenegger O
as O
obsessed O
with O
power O
and O
quotes O
him O
as O
saying O
, O
`` O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
part O
of O
the O
small O
percentage O
of O
people O
who O
were O
leaders O
, O
not O
the O
large O
mass O
of O
followers O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
because O
I O
saw O
leaders O
use O
100 O
% O
of O
their O
potential O
I O
was O
always O
fascinated O
by O
people O
in O
control O
of O
other O
people O

'' O

Schwarzenegger O
has O
said O
that O
it O
was O
never O
his O
intention O
to O
enter O
politics O
, O
but O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
I O
married O

together O

the O

of O
being O

Sargent O
Shriver O

He O

In O

, O
it O
is O
revealed O
that O
a O
constitutional O
amendment O

which O
allowed O

to O
become O

Schwarzenegger O
is O
a O
dual O

He O
holds O

in O
1983 B-KP

to O
win O

Schwarzenegger O
's O
endorsement O
in O
the O
Republican O
primary O
of O
the O
2008 O
U.S. O
presidential O
election O
was O
highly O
sought O

despite O
being O
good O
friends O
with O
candidates O
Rudy B-KP

Senator O

Schwarzenegger O
remained O
neutral O

early O
2008 O

Giuliani O
dropped O
out O
of O
the O
presidential O
race O
on O
January O
30 O
, O
2008 O
, O
largely O
because O
of O
a O
poor O

endorsed O

Later O

The O

`` O

( O
in O

that O
he O
could O
not O
make O
up O
his O

. O

Schwarzenegger O

was O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
boost O
for O
Senator O

campaign O

both O

Washington I-KP
named O

one O
of O
11 O
`` O

'' O
in O
the O
United O

because O
of O
various O
ethics O

throughout O
Schwarzenegger O

term O
as O
governor O

Although O
he O
began O
his O
tenure O

with O

high O
approval O
ratings O
( O
as O
high O
as O
89 B-KP

, O
he O
left O

low O
23 B-KP

only O
one O

higher O
than O
that O
of O
Gray O

when O
he O
was O
recalled O
in O
October O
2003 O
. O

During O
his O
initial O
campaign O
for O
governor O
, O
allegations O
of O
sexual O
and O
personal O
misconduct O
were O
raised O
against O
Schwarzenegger O
, O
dubbed O
`` O
Gropegate B-KP

. O

Within O
the O
last O
five O
days O
before O
the O

, O
news O
reports O
appeared O
in O
the O
Los B-KP

recounting O
allegations O
of O

from O
several O
individual O
women O

six B-KP

whom O
eventually O
came O
forward O
with O
their O
personal O
stories O

Three O
of O
the O
women O
claimed O
he O
had O
grabbed O
their O
breasts O

a O
fourth O
said O
he O
placed O
his O
hand O
under O
her O
skirt O
on O
her O
buttock O
. O

A O
fifth O
woman O
claimed O
Schwarzenegger O
tried O
to O
take O
off O
her O
bathing B-KP
suit I-KP
in O
a O
hotel O
elevator O
, O
and O
the O
last O
said O
he O
pulled O
her O
onto O
his O
lap O
and O
asked O
her O
about O
a O
sex O
act O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
admitted O
that O
he O
has O
`` O
behaved O
badly O
sometimes O
'' O
and O
apologized O
, O
but O
also O
stated O
that O
`` O
a O

[ O
what O

you O
see O
in O
the O

This O
came O
after O
an O
interview O
in O
adult O
magazine O
Oui O
from O
1977 O
surfaced O
, O
in O
which O
Schwarzenegger O
discussed O
attending O
sexual O
orgies O

using O
substances O
such O
as O
marijuana B-KP

In O
an O
interview O
with O

'' O

His O

later O
said O
the O
comment O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
joke O

British O
television O
personality O
Anna B-KP
Richardson I-KP
settled O
a O
libel O
lawsuit O
in O
August O
2006 O
against O
Schwarzenegger O
, O
his O
top O
aide O
, O
Sean O
Walsh O

his O

A O

Richardson O
claimed O
they O
tried O
to O
tarnish O
her O
reputation O
by O
dismissing O
her O

that O

touched O
her O
breast O
during O
a O
press O
event O
for O
The B-KP
6th I-KP

She O
claimed O

libeled O
her O
in O
a O
Los B-KP

article O
when O
they O
contended O
she O
encouraged O
his O
behavior O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
became O
a O
naturalized O
U.S. O
citizen O
on O
September O
17 O
, O
1983 O
. O

Shortly O
before O
he O
gained O
his O
citizenship O
, O
he O
asked O
the O
Austrian O
authorities O
for O
the O
right O
to O
keep O
his O
Austrian O
citizenship O
, O
as O
Austria O
does O
not O
usually O
allow O
dual O
citizenship O
. O

His O
request O
was O
granted O
, O
and O
he O
retained O
his O
Austrian O
citizenship O
. O

In O
2005 O
, O
Peter B-KP
Pilz I-KP
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Austrian O
Parliament O
from O
the O
Austrian O
Green O
Party O
, O
demanded O
that O
Parliament O
revoke O
Schwarzenegger O

Austrian O
citizenship O
due O
to O
his O
decision O
not O
to O
prevent O
the O
executions O
of O
Donald O
Beardslee O

Stanley O
Williams O
, O
causing O
damage O
of O
reputation O
to O
Austria O
, O
where O
the O
death O
penalty O
has O
been O
abolished O
since O
1968 B-KP
. O

This O
demand O
was O
based O
on O
Article O
33 O
of O
the O
Austrian O
Citizenship O
Act O
that O
states O
: O
`` O
A O

he O
heavily O
damages O
the O
reputation O
or O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
Austrian O
Republic O

'' O

Pilz O
claimed O
that O
Schwarzenegger O

actions O
in O
support O
of O
the O
death O

( O
prohibited O
in O
Austria O
under O
Protocol O
13 O
of O
the O
European O
Convention O
on O
Human O
Rights O
) O
had O
indeed O
done O
damage O
to O
Austria O
's O
reputation O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
explained O
his O
actions O
by O
referring O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
his O
only O
duty O
as O
Governor O
of O
California O
was O
to O
prevent O
an O

in O
the O

On O

Schwarzenegger O
signed O
a O
bill O
creating O
the O
nation O

Schwarzenegger O
talked O
about O

in O

: O
`` O

it O

I O

not O

hated O

Baker O

described O

claims O

that O

that O

plans O

to O
falsify O
a O
public O

, O
a O
serious O
crime O
in O
California O
. O

Schwarzenegger B-KP
has O
consulted O
an O
attorney O
, O
Bob B-KP
Kaufman I-KP
. O

Kaufman O
has O
earlier O
handled O
divorce O
cases O
for O
celebrities O
such O
as O
Jennifer O
Aniston O
and O
Reese O
Witherspoon O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
will O
keep O
the O
Brentwood O
home O
as O
part O
of O
their O
divorce O
settlement O
and O
Shriver O
has O
purchased O
a O
new O
home O
nearby O
so O
that O
the O
children O
may O
travel O
easily O
between O
their O
parents O
' O
homes O
. O

They O
will O
share O
custody O
of O
the O
two O
minor O
children O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
came O
under O
fire O
after O
the O
initial O
petition O
did O
not O
include O
spousal B-KP
support I-KP
and O
a O
reimbursement O
of O
attorney O
's O
fees O
. O

However O
, O
he O
claims O
this O
was O
not O
intentional O
and O
that O
he O
signed O
the O
initial O
documents O
without O
having O
properly O
read O
them O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
has O
filed O
amended O
divorce O
papers O
remedying O
this O
. O

After O
the O
scandal O
, O
actress O
Brigitte B-KP
Nielsen I-KP
came O
forward O
and O
stated O
that O
she O
too O
had O
an O
affair O
with O
Schwarzenegger O
while O
he O
was O
in O
a O
relationship O
with O
Shriver O
, O
saying O
, O
`` O
Maybe O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
got O
into O
it O
if O
he O
said O
'I O
'm O
going O
to O
marry O
Maria O
' O
and O
this O
is O
dead O
serious O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
, O
and O
our O
affair O
carried O
on O
. O
'' O

When O
asked O
in O
2014 O
`` O
Of O
all O
the O
things O
you O
are O
famous O
for O
which O
are O
you O
least O
proud O
of O
? O

`` O
, O
Schwarzenegger O
replied O
`` O
I O
'm O
least O
proud O
of O
the O
mistakes O
I O
made O
that O
caused O
my O
family O
pain O
and O
split O
us O
up O

Schwarzenegger O
was O
born O
with O
a O
bicuspid B-KP
aortic O
valve O
, O
an O
aortic O
valve O
with O
only O
two O
leaflets O
( O
a O
normal O
aortic O
valve O
has O
three O
leaflets O
) O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
opted O
in O
1997 B-KP
for O
a O
replacement O
heart O
valve O
made O
of O
his O
own O
transplanted O
tissue O
; O
medical O
experts O
predicted O
he O
would O
require O
heart O
valve O
replacement O
surgery O
in O
the O
following O
two O
to O
eight O
years O
as O
his O
valve O
would O
progressively O
degrade O
. O

Schwarzenegger O
apparently O
opted O
against O
a O
mechanical O
valve O
, O
the O
only O
permanent O
solution O
available O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
surgery O
, O
because O
it O
would O
have O
sharply O
limited O
his O
physical O
activity O
and O
capacity O
to O
exercise O
. O

On O

by O
the O
building O
of O
a O
fort O
( O

on O
the O
Hoe O
before O
engaging O
the O
Spanish O

Throughout O
the O

Plymouth O
had O
gradually O
lost O
its O

as O
a O

By O
the O
mid O

the O
city O
had O
no O

although O
it O
did O
play O
a O
relatively O
small O

in O
the O
Atlantic O

was O
from O
the O
