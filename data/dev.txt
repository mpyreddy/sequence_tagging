which O
divides O
the O
city O
into O
two O
parts O
, O
left O

The O
flora O
of O
the O
city O
may O
be O
considered O
very O
rich O
in O
species O
. O

The O
species O
richness O
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
the O
location B-KP
of I-KP
Warsaw I-KP
within O
the O

region O
of O
several O

In O
1939 O
, O
c. O
1,300,000 B-KP
people O
lived O
in O
Warsaw O
, O
but O
in O
1945 O
only O
420,000 B-KP
. O

During O
the O
first O
years O
after O
the O
war O
, O
the O
population O
growth O
was O
c. O
6 O
% O
, O
so O
shortly O
the O
city O
started O
to O
suffer O
from O
the O
lack O
of O
flats O
and O
of O
areas O
for O
new O
houses O
. O

The O
first O
remedial O
measure O
was O
the O
Warsaw O
area O
enlargement O
( O
1951 B-KP
) O
but O
the O
city O
authorities O
were O
still O
forced O
to O
introduce O
residency O
registration O
limitations O
: O
only O
the O
spouses O
and O
children O
of O
the O
permanent O
residents O
as O
well O
as O
some O
persons O
of O
public O
importance O
( O
like O
renowned O
specialists O
) O
were O
allowed O
to O
get O
the O
registration O
, O
hence O
halving O
the O
population O
growth O
in O
the O
following O
years O
. O

It O
also O
bolstered O
some O
kind O
of O
conviction O
among O
Poles O
that O
Varsovians O
thought B-KP
of I-KP
themselves I-KP
as I-KP
better B-KP
only O
because O
they O
lived O
in O
the O
capital O
. O

Unfortunately O
this O
belief O
still O
lives O
on O
in O
Poland O
( O
although O
not O
as O
much O
as O
it O
used O
to O
be O
) O
even O
though O
since O
1990 O
there O
are O
no O
limitations O
to O
residency B-KP
registration I-KP
anymore O
. O

Throughout O
its O
existence O
, O
Warsaw O
has O
been O
a O
multi B-KP
cultural I-KP
city I-KP
. O

According O
to O
the O
1901 O
census O
, O
out O
of O
711,988 B-KP
inhabitants O
56.2 B-KP
% I-KP
were O
Catholics O
, O
35.7 B-KP
% O
Jews O
, O
5 O
% O
Greek O
orthodox O
Christians O
and O
2.8 B-KP
% I-KP
Protestants O
. O

Eight O
years O
later O
, O
in O
1909 O
, O
there O
were O
281,754 O
Jews O
( O
36.9 O
% O
) O
, O
18,189 O
Protestants O
( O
2.4 O
% O
) O
and O
2,818 O
Mariavites O
( O
0.4 O
% O
) O
. O

This O
led O
to O
construction O
of O
hundreds O
of O
places O
of O
religious O
worship O
in O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
town O
. O

Most O
of O
them O
were O
destroyed O
in O
the O
aftermath O
of O
the O
Warsaw O
Uprising O
of O
1944 B-KP
. O

After O
the O
war O
, O
the O
new O
communist O
authorities O
of O
Poland O
discouraged O
church O
construction O
and O
only O
a O
small O
number O
were O
rebuilt O
. O

The O
basic O
unit O
of O
territorial O
division O
in O
Poland O
is O
a B-KP
commune B-KP
( O
gmina O
) O
. O

A O
city O
is O
also O
a O
commune O
but O
with O
the O
city O
charter O
. O

Both O
cities O
and O
communes O
are O
governed O
by O
a O
mayor O
but O
in O
the O
communes O
the O
mayor O
is O
vogt O
( O
w O
jt O
in O
Polish O
) O
, O
however O
in O
the O
cities O
burmistrz O
. O

Some O
bigger O
cities O
obtain O
the O
entitlements O
, O
i.e O
. O

tasks O
and O
privileges O
, O
which O
are O
possessed O
by O
the O
units O
of O
the O
second O
level O
of O
the O
territorial O
division O
counties B-KP
or I-KP
powiats I-KP
. O

An O
example O
of O
such O
entitlement O
is O
a O
car O
registration O
: O
a O
gmina O
can O
not O
register O
cars O
, O
this O
is O
a O
powiat O
's O
task O
( O
i.e O
. O

a O
registration O
number O
depends O
on O
what O
powiat O
a O
car O
had O
been O
registered O
, O
not O
gmina O
) O
. O

In O
this O
case O
we O
say O
about O
city O
county O
or O
powiat O
grodzki O

Such O
cities O
are O
for O

have O
some O

, O
the O

for O

the O

the O
initially O
destructive O

The O
Duchy O
of O
Normandy O
, O
which O
began O
in O
911 B-KP

established O
by O
the O

was O
situated O
in O
the O
former O
Frankish O

The O
treaty O
offered O
Rollo O

his O

the O
French O
lands O
between O
the O
river O
Epte B-KP

the O
Atlantic O
coast O

the O
northern O

Upper O

to O
the O

Seine B-KP
, O
but O
the O
Duchy O
would O
eventually O
extend O
west O

the O
Seine O

The O
territory O
was O
roughly O
equivalent O
to O
the O
old O
province O
of O
Rouen O
, O
and O
reproduced O
the O
Roman O
administrative O
structure O
of O
Gallia O

Earlier O

were O

the O

remained O
about O

Rollo O

contingents O
who O
raided O

ultimately O
settled O
Normandy O

parts O

possibly O
Swedes O

and O
Anglo O

under O

The O
descendants O
of O
Rollo O
's O
Vikings O
and O
their O
Frankish O
wives O
would O
replace O
the O
Norse O
religion O
and O
Old O
Norse O
language O
with O
Catholicism B-KP
( O
Christianity O
) O
and O
the O
Gallo O

of O
the O
local O
people O
, O
blending O
their O
maternal O
Frankish O
heritage O
with O
Old O
Norse O
traditions O
and O
customs O
to O
synthesize O
a O
unique O
`` O
Norman O
'' O
culture O
in O
the B-KP
north B-KP
of O
France O
. O

The O
Norman O
language O
was O
forged O
by O
the O
adoption O
of O
the O
indigenous O
langue O
d'o O
l O
branch O
of O
Romance O
by O
a O
Norse O
speaking O
ruling O
class O
, O
and O
it O
developed O
into O
the O
regional O
language O
that O
survives O
today O
. O

The O
Normans O
thereafter O
adopted O
the O
growing O
feudal O
doctrines O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
France O
, O
and O
worked O
them O
into O
a O
functional O
hierarchical O
system O
in O
both O
Normandy O
and O
in O
England O
. O

The O
new O
Norman O
rulers O
were O
culturally O
and O
ethnically O
distinct O
from O
the O
old O
French O
aristocracy O
, O
most O
of O
whom O
traced O
their O
lineage O
to O
Franks O
of O
the O
Carolingian O

Most O
Norman O
knights O
remained O
poor O

land O
hungry O
, O
and O

1066 O
Normandy O

which O
they O
did O

The O
two O
most O
prominent O
Norman O
families O
to O
arrive O
in O
the O
Mediterranean O
were O
descendants O
of O
Tancred O
of O
Hauteville O
and O
the O
Drengot O
family O
, O
of O
whom O
Rainulf O
Drengot O
received O
the O
county O

the O
first O
Norman O
toehold O
in O
the O
south O
, O
from O
Duke O
Sergius O
IV O
of O
Naples O
in O
1030 O
. O

The O
Hauteville O
family O
achieved O
princely O
rank O
by O
proclaiming O
prince O
Guaimar O
IV O
of O
Salerno O
`` O
Duke O
of O

He O
promptly O

with O
the O
title O
of O

in O
his O

The O
Drengot O
family O
thereafter O
attained O
the O
principality O
of O

legally O
ennobled O

in O

From O
these O
bases O
, O
the O
Normans O
eventually O
captured O
Sicily O

Malta O
from O
the B-KP
Saracens B-KP

under O
the O

of O
the O
famous O
Robert O

Roger O
the O
Great O
Count O

Roger O

son O
, O
Roger O
II O
of O
Sicily O
, O
was O
crowned O
king O
in O
1130 B-KP
( O
exactly O
one O
century O
after O
Rainulf O
was O
`` O
crowned O

) O
by O
Antipope O
Anacletus O

The O
Kingdom O
of O
Sicily O
lasted O
until O
1194 O
, O
when O
it O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
House O
of O
Hohenstaufen O
through O
marriage O
. O

The O
Normans O
left O
their O
legacy O
in O
many O
castles O
, O
such O
as O
William O
Iron O
Arm O

citadel O
at O
Squillace B-KP

and O
cathedrals O
, O
such O
as O
Roger O

at O
Palermo O
, O
which O
dot O
the O
landscape O
and O
give O
a O
wholly O
distinct O
architectural O
flavor O
to O
accompany O
its O
unique O
history O
. O

Institutionally O
, O
the O
Normans O
combined O
the O
administrative O
machinery O
of O
the O
Byzantines O
, O
Arabs O
, O
and O
Lombards O
with O
their O
own O
conceptions O
of O
feudal O
law O
and O
order O
to O
forge O
a O
unique O
government O
. O

Under O
this O
state O
, O
there O
was O
great O
religious O
freedom O
, O
and O
alongside O
the O
Norman O
nobles O
existed O
a O
meritocratic B-KP
bureaucracy O
of O
Jews O
, O
Muslims O
and O
Christians O
, O
both O
Catholic O
and O
Eastern O
Orthodox O
. O

The O
Kingdom O
of O
Sicily O
thus O
became O
characterized O
by O
Norman O
, O
Byzantine O
Greek O
, O
Arab O
, O
Lombard O
and O
`` O
native O
'' O
Sicilian O
populations O
living O
in O
harmony O
, O
and O
its O
Norman O
rulers O
fostered O
plans O
of O
establishing O
an O
Empire O
that O
would O
have O
encompassed O
Fatimid O
Egypt O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Crusader O

in O

the O
great O

Soon O
after O
the O

began O
to O
enter O
Italy O
, O
they O
entered O
the O
Byzantine O
Empire O

then O

Norman O
mercenaries O
were O
first O
encouraged O
to O
come O
to O
the O
south O
by O
the O
Lombards O
to O
act O
against O
the O
Byzantines O
, O
but O
they O
soon O
fought O
in O
Byzantine O
service O
in O
Sicily O
. O

They O
were O
prominent O
alongside O
Varangian O
and O
Lombard O
contingents O
in O
the O
Sicilian O
campaign O
of O
George O
Maniaces O
in O
1038 O

. O

There O
is O
debate O
whether O
the O
Normans O
in O
Greek O
service O
actually O
were O
from O
Norman O
Italy O
, O
and O
it O
now O
seems O
likely O
only O
a O
few O
came O
from O
there O
. O

It O
is O
also O
unknown O
how O
many O
of O
the O
`` O
Franks O
'' O
, O
as O
the O
Byzantines O
called O
them O
, O
were O
Normans O
and O
not O
other O
Frenchmen O
. O

One O
of O
the O
first O
Norman O
mercenaries O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
Byzantine O
general O
was O
Herv O
in B-KP
the I-KP
1050s I-KP
. O

By O
then O
however O
, O
there O
were O
already O
Norman O
mercenaries O
serving O
as O
far O
away O
as O
Trebizond O
and O
Georgia O
. O

They O
were O
based O
at O
Malatya O
and O
Edessa O
, O
under O
the O
Byzantine O
duke O
of O
Antioch O
, O
Isaac O
Komnenos O
. O

In B-KP
the I-KP
1060s I-KP
, O
Robert O
Crispin O
led O
the O
Normans O
of O
Edessa O
against O
the O
Turks O
. O

Roussel O
de O
Bailleul O
even O
tried O
to O
carve O
out O
an O
independent O
state O
in O
Asia O
Minor O
with O
support O
from O
the O
local O
population O
, O
but O
he O
was O
stopped O
by O
the O
Byzantine O
general O
Alexius B-KP
Komnenos I-KP

Some O
Normans O
joined O
Turkish B-KP
forces I-KP
to O
aid O
in O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
Armenians O
vassal O
states O
of O
Sassoun O

took O
up O
service O
with O
the O
Armenian O
state O
further O
south O
in O
Cilicia O
and O
the O
Taurus O

. O

A O
Norman O

Oursel B-KP
led O
a O
force O
of O
`` O

into O
the O
upper O
Euphrates O

From O

, O
8,000 O
of O
the O
20,000 O
troops O
of O
the O
Armenian O
general O
Philaretus O
Brachamius O
were O
Normans O
formerly O

They O
even O
lent O

The O
known O
trade O
between O
Amalfi O
and O
Antioch O
and O
between O
Bari O
and O
Tarsus O
may O
be O
related O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
Italo O
Normans O
in O
those O
cities O
while O
Amalfi O
and O
Bari O
were O
under O
Norman O
rule O
in O

Several O
families O
of O
Byzantine O
Greece O
were O
of O
Norman B-KP
mercenary I-KP
origin O
during O
the O
period O
of O
the O
Comnenian O
Restoration O
, O
when O
Byzantine O
emperors O
were O
seeking O
out O
western O
European O
warriors O

The O
Raoulii O
were O
descended B-KP
from I-KP
an I-KP
Italo I-KP
Norman I-KP
named I-KP
Raoul I-KP
, O
the O
Petraliphae O
were O
descended O

a O
Pierre O

, O
and O
that O
group O
of O
Albanian O
clans O
known O
as O
the O
Maniakates O
were O
descended O
from O
Normans O
who O
served O
under O
George O
Maniaces O
in O
the O
Sicilian O
expedition O
of O
1038 O

Robert B-KP
Guiscard I-KP
, O
an O
other O
Norman O
adventurer O
previously O
elevated O
to O
the O
dignity O
of O
count O
of O
Apulia O
as O
the O
result O
of O
his O
military O
successes O
, O
ultimately O
drove O
the O
Byzantines O
out O
of O
southern O
Italy O
. O

Having O
obtained O
the O
consent O
of O
pope O
Gregory O
VII O
and O
acting O
as O
his O
vassal O
, O
Robert O
continued O
his O
campaign O
conquering O
the O
Balkan O
peninsula O
as O
a O
foothold O
for O
western O
feudal O
lords O
and O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
. O

After O
allying O
himself O
with O
Croatia O
and O
the O
Catholic O
cities O
of O
Dalmatia O
, O
in O
1081 O
he O
led O
an O
army O
of O
30,000 B-KP
men O
in O
300 O
ships O
landing O
on O
the O
southern O
shores O
of O
Albania O
, O
capturing O
Valona O
, O
Kanina O
, O
Jericho O
( O
Orikumi O
) O
, O
and O
reaching O
Butrint O
after O
numerous O
pillages O
. O

They O
joined O
the O
fleet O
that O
had O
previously O
conquered O
Corfu O
and O
attacked O
Dyrrachium O
from O
land O
and O
sea O
, O
devastating O
everything O
along O
the O
way O
. O

Under O
these O
harsh O
circumstances O
, O
the O
locals O
accepted O
the O
call O
of O
emperor O
Alexius O
I O
Comnenus O
to O
join O
forces O
with O
the O
Byzantines O
against O
the O
Normans O
. O

The O
Albanian O
forces O
could O
not O
take O
part O
in O
the O
ensuing O
battle O
because O
it O
had O
started O
before O
their O
arrival O
. O

Immediately O
before O
the O
battle O
, O
the O
Venetian O
fleet O
had O
secured O
a O
victory O
in O
the O
coast O
surrounding O
the O
city O
. O

Forced O
to O
retreat O
, O
Alexius O
ceded O
the O
command O
to O
a O
high O
Albanian O
official O
named O
Comiscortes O
in O
the O
service O
of O
Byzantium O
. O

The O
city O
's O
garrison O
resisted O
until O
February B-KP
1082 I-KP
, O
when O
Dyrrachium O
was O
betrayed O
to O
the O
Normans O
by O
the O
Venetian O
and O
Amalfitan O
merchants O
who O
had O
settled O
there O
. O

The O
Normans O
were O
now O
free O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
hinterland O
; O
they O
took O
Ioannina O
and O
some O
minor O
cities O
in O
southwestern O
Macedonia O
and O
Thessaly O
before O
appearing O
at O
the O
gates O
of O
Thessalonica O
. O

Dissension O
among O
the O
high O
ranks O
coerced O
the O
Normans O
to O
retreat O
to O
Italy O
. O

They O
lost O
Dyrrachium O
, O
Valona O
, O
and O
Butrint O
in O
1085 O
, O
after O
the O
death O
of O
Robert O
. O

A O
few O
years O
after O
the O
First O
Crusade O
, O
in O
1107 O
, O
the O
Normans O
under O
the O
command O
of O
Bohemond B-KP
, O
Robert O
's O
son O
, O
landed O
in O
Valona O
and O
besieged O
Dyrrachium O
using O
the O
most O
sophisticated O
military O
equipment O
of O
the O
time O
, O
but O
to O
no O
avail O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
they O
occupied O
Petrela O
, O
the O
citadel O
of O
Mili O
at O
the O
banks O
of O
the B-KP
river I-KP
Deabolis B-KP
, O
Gllavenica O
( O
Ballsh O
) O
, O
Kanina O
and O
Jericho O
. O

This O
time O
, O
the O
Albanians O
sided O
with O
the O
Normans O
, O
dissatisfied O
by O
the O
heavy O
taxes O
the O
Byzantines O
had O
imposed O
upon O
them O
. O

With O
their O
help O
, O
the O
Normans O
secured O
the O
Arbanon O
passes O
and O
opened O
their O
way O
to O
Dibra O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
supplies O
, O
disease O
and O
Byzantine O
resistance O
forced O
Bohemond O
to O
retreat O
from O
his O
campaign O
and O
sign O
a O
peace O
treaty O
with O
the O
Byzantines O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Deabolis B-KP
. O

The O
further O
decline O
of O
Byzantine O
state O
of O
affairs O
paved O
the O
road O
to O
a O
third O
attack O
in B-KP
1185 B-KP
, O
when O
a O
large O
Norman O
army O
invaded O
Dyrrachium B-KP
, O
owing O
to O
the O
betrayal O
of O
high O
Byzantine O
officials O
. O

Some O
time O
later O
, O
Dyrrachium B-KP
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
naval O
bases O
of O
the B-KP
Adriatic B-KP
fell O
again O
to O
Byzantine O
hands O
. O

The O
Normans O
were O
in O
contact O
with O
England O
from O
an O
early O
date O
. O

Not O
only O
were O
their O
original O
Viking O
brethren O
still O
ravaging O
the O
English O
coasts O
, O
they O
occupied O
most O
of O
the O
important O
ports O
opposite O
England O
across O
the O
English O
Channel O
. O

This O
relationship O
eventually O
produced O
closer O
ties O
of O
blood O
through O
the O
marriage O
of O
Emma O
, O
sister O
of O
Duke B-KP
Richard I-KP
II I-KP
of O
Normandy O
, O
and O
King B-KP
Ethelred I-KP
II I-KP
of O
England O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
Ethelred O
fled O
to O
Normandy B-KP
in O
1013 O
, O
when O
he O
was O
forced O
from O
his O
kingdom O
by O
Sweyn B-KP
Forkbeard I-KP
. O

His O
stay O
in O
Normandy O
( O
until O
1016 O
) O
influenced O
him O
and O
his O
sons O
by O
Emma O
, O
who O
stayed O
in O
Normandy O
after O
Cnut O
the O
Great O
's O
conquest O
of O
the O
isle O
. O

When O
finally O
Edward O
the O
Confessor O
returned O
from O
his O
father O
's O
refuge O
in B-KP
1041 B-KP
, O
at O
the O
invitation O
of O
his O
half O
brother O
Harthacnut B-KP
, O
he O
brought O
with O
him O
a O
Norman O
educated O
mind O
. O

He O
also O
brought O
many O
Norman O
counsellors O
and O
fighters O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
established O
an O
English O
cavalry O
force O
. O

This O
concept O
never O
really O
took O
root O
, O
but O
it O
is O
a O
typical O
example O
of O
the O
attitudes O
of O
Edward O
. O

He O
appointed O
Robert B-KP
of I-KP
Jumi I-KP
ges I-KP
archbishop O
of O
Canterbury O
and O
made O
Ralph O
the O
Timid O
earl O
of O
Hereford O
. O

He O
invited O
his O
brother O
in O
law O
Eustace O
II O
, O
Count O
of O
Boulogne O
to O
his O
court O
in O
1051 O
, O
an O
event O
which O
resulted O
in O
the O
greatest O
of O
early O
conflicts O
between O
Saxon O
and O
Norman O
and O
ultimately O
resulted O
in O
the O
exile O
of O
Earl O
Godwin O
of O
Wessex O
. O

In B-KP
1066 B-KP

the O

The O

Early O
Norman O
kings O
of O
England O
, O
as O
Dukes O
of O
Normandy O
, O
owed O
homage O
to O
the O
King O
of O
France O
for O
their O
land O
on O
the O
continent O
. O

They O
considered O
England O
to O
be O
their O
most O
important O
holding O
( O
it O
brought O
with O
it O
the O
title O
of O
King O
an O
important O
status O

) O
. O

Eventually O
, O
the O
Normans O
merged O
with O
the O
natives O
, O
combining O
languages O
and O
traditions O
. O

In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
Hundred O
Years O
' O
War O
, O
the O
Norman O
aristocracy O
often O
identified O
themselves O
as O
English O
. O

The O
Anglo O
Norman O
language O
became O
distinct O
from O
the O
Latin O
language O
, O
something O
that O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
some O
humour O
by O
Geoffrey O
Chaucer O
. O

The O
Anglo O
Norman O
language O
was O
eventually O
absorbed O
into O
the O
Anglo O
Saxon O
language O
of O
their O
subjects O
( O

Old O
English O
) O
and O
influenced O
it O

the O

by O
the O

It O
in O

Modern B-KP

The O
Normans O
had O
a O
profound O
effect O
on O
Irish B-KP
culture O
and O
history O
after O
their O
invasion O
at O
Bannow O
Bay O
in O
1169 B-KP
. O

Initially O
the O
Normans O
maintained O
a O
distinct O
culture O
and O
ethnicity O
. O

Yet O
, O
with O
time O
, O
they O
came O
to O
be O
subsumed O
into O
Irish B-KP
culture O
to O
the O
point O
that O
it O
has O
been O
said O
that O
they O
became O
`` O
more O
Irish O
than O
the O
Irish O
themselves O
. O
'' O

The O
Normans O
settled O
mostly O
in O
an O
area O
in O
the O
east O
of O
Ireland B-KP
, O
later O
known O
as O
the O
Pale O
, O
and O
also O
built O
many O
fine O
castles O

Trim O

Dublin O

Both O

Isaac O

However O
, O
in B-KP
the I-KP
early I-KP
11th I-KP
century I-KP
the O
dukes B-KP
began O
a O
programme O
of O
church O
reform O
, O
encouraging O
the O
Cluniac O
reform O
of O
monasteries O
and O
patronising O
intellectual O
pursuits O
, O
especially O
the O
proliferation O
of O
scriptoria O
and O
the O
reconstitution O
of O
a O
compilation O
of O
lost O
illuminated O
manuscripts O
. O

The O
church O
was O
utilised O
by O
the B-KP
dukes B-KP
as O
a O
unifying O
force O
for O
their O
disparate O
duchy O
. O

The O
chief O
monasteries O
taking O
part O
in O
this O
`` O
renaissance O
'' O
of O
Norman O
art O
and O
scholarship O
were O
Mont O
Saint O
Michel O

, O
Jumi O

, O
Bec O
, O
Saint O
Ouen O
, O
Saint O
Evroul O
, O
and O
Saint O
Wandrille O
. O

These O
centres O
were O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
so O
called O
`` O
Winchester O
school O
'' O
, O
which O
channeled O
a O
pure O
Carolingian O
artistic O
tradition O
to O
Normandy O
. O

In O
the O
final O
decade O
of O
the O
11th O
and O
first O
of O
the O
12th O
century O
, O
Normandy O
experienced O
a O
golden O
age O
of O
illustrated O
manuscripts O
, O
but O
it O
was O
brief O
and O
the O
major O
scriptoria O
of O
Normandy O
ceased O
to O
function O
after O
the O
midpoint O
of O
the O
century O
. O

The O
French O
Wars O
of O
Religion O
in B-KP
the I-KP
16th I-KP
century I-KP
and O
French O
Revolution O
in O
the O
18th O
successively O
destroyed O
much O
of O
what O
existed O
in O
the O
way O
of O
the O
architectural O
and O
artistic O
remnant O
of O
this O
Norman O
creativity O
. O

The O
former O
, O
with O
their O
violence O
, O
caused O
the O
wanton O
destruction O
of O
many O
Norman O
edifices O
; O
the O
latter O
, O
with O
its O
assault O
on O
religion O
, O
caused O
the O
purposeful O
destruction O
of O
religious O
objects O
of O
any O
type O
, O
and O
its O
destabilisation O
of O
society O
resulted O
in O
rampant O
pillaging O
. O

By O
far O
the O
most O
famous O
work O
of O
Norman O
art O
is O
the B-KP
Bayeux I-KP
Tapestry I-KP
, O
which O
is O
not O
a O
tapestry O
but O
a O
work O
of O
embroidery B-KP
. O

It O
was O
commissioned O
by O
Odo B-KP
, O
the O
Bishop O
of O
Bayeux O
and O
first O
Earl O
of O
Kent O
, O
employing O
natives O
from O
Kent O
who O
were O
learned O
in O
the O
Nordic O
traditions O
imported O
in O
the O
previous O
half O
century O
by O
the O
Danish O
Vikings O
. O

In O
Britain O
, O
Norman O
art O
primarily O
survives O
as O
stonework O
or O
metalwork O
, O
such O
as O
capitals O
and O
baptismal O
fonts O
. O

In O
southern O
Italy O
, O
however O
, O
Norman O
artwork O
survives O
plentifully O
in O
forms O
strongly O
influenced O
by O
its O
Greek O
, O
Lombard O
, O
and O
Arab O
forebears O
. O

Of O
the O
royal O
regalia O
preserved O
in O
Palermo O
, O
the O
crown O
is O
Byzantine O
in O
style O
and O
the O
coronation O
cloak O
is O
of O
Arab O
craftsmanship O
with O
Arabic O
inscriptions O
. O

Many O
churches O
preserve O
sculptured O
fonts O
, O
capitals O
, O
and O
more O
importantly O
mosaics B-KP
, O
which O
were O
common O
in O
Norman O
Italy O
and O
drew O
heavily O
on O
the O
Greek O
heritage O
. O

Lombard O
Salerno O
was O
a O
centre O
of O
ivorywork O
in O
the O
11th O
century O
and O
this O
continued O
under O
Norman O
domination O
. O

Finally O
should O
be O
noted O
the O
intercourse O
between O
French O
Crusaders O
traveling O
to O
the O
Holy O
Land O
who O
brought O
with O
them O
French O
artefacts O
with O
which O
to O
gift O
the O
churches O
at O
which O
they O
stopped O
in O
southern O
Italy O
amongst O
their O
Norman O
cousins O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
many O
south O
Italian O
churches O
preserve O
works O
from O
France O
alongside O
their O
native O
pieces O
. O

Normandy O
was O
the O
site O
of O

later O
he O
was O

Milutin O
Tesla O
died O
at O
the O
age O

( O
although O
some O

In B-KP
January I-KP
1880 I-KP
, O
two B-KP

Prague B-KP
where O
he O
was O
to O

he I-KP
never I-KP
studied I-KP
Greek I-KP

Tesla O
did O
, O
however O
, O
attend O

although O
, O
as B-KP
an I-KP

, O
he O
did O
not O
receive O

In O
1881 B-KP
, O
Tesla O
moved O
to B-KP
Budapest B-KP
to O
work O
under O
Ferenc O
Pusk O

at O
a B-KP
telegraph I-KP
company I-KP
, O
the B-KP
Budapest B-KP
Telephone I-KP

Upon O
arrival O
, O
Tesla O
realized O
that O
the O
company O
, O
then O
under O
construction O
, O
was O
not O
functional O
, O
so O
he O
worked O
as O
a O
draftsman B-KP
in O
the O
Central O
Telegraph O
Office O
instead O
. O

Within O
a O
few O
months O
, O
the O
Budapest B-KP
Telephone I-KP
Exchange I-KP
became O
functional O
and O
Tesla O
was O
allocated O
the O
chief B-KP
electrician I-KP
position O
. O

During O
his O
employment O
, O
Tesla O
made O
many O
improvements O
to O
the O
Central O
Station O
equipment O
and O
claimed O
to O
have O
perfected O
a B-KP
telephone I-KP
repeater I-KP
or I-KP

, O
which O
was O
never O
patented O

In O
1882 B-KP
, O
Tesla O
began O
working O

the O
Continental B-KP
Edison I-KP
Company I-KP
in B-KP

In O
June O
1884 B-KP

Tesla O

work O
for O
Edison O
began O
with O
simple O
electrical O

and O
quickly O
progressed O
to O
solving O
more O
difficult O
problems O

Tesla O
was O
offered O
the O
task O
of O
completely O
redesigning O
the O
Edison O
Company O

direct O
current O

. O

In O
1885 O
, O
he O
said O
that O
he O
could O
redesign O
Edison O
's O
inefficient O
motor O
and O
generators O
, O
making O
an O
improvement O
in O
both O
service O
and O
economy O
. O

According O
to O
Tesla O
, O
Edison O
remarked O
, O
`` O
There O

`` O

This O
has O
been O
noted O
as O
an O

statement O
from O
an O

was O
stingy O
with O

who O
did O
not O
have O

After O
months B-KP
of O
work O
, O
Tesla O
fulfilled O
the O
task O
and O
inquired O
about O

Edison O
, O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
only O

replied O
, O
`` O

ideas O
for O
new O
types O
of O

also O
seemed O
to O
think O
it O
was O
better O
to O
develop O
an O

They O
eventually O
forced B-KP
Tesla I-KP
out I-KP
leaving I-KP
him I-KP
penniless B-KP

He O
even O
lost O
control O

Tesla O
considered O
the O

1886/1887 B-KP
as O
a O
time O
of O
`` O
terrible O
headaches O

One O
of O
the O

Tesla O
refused O
to O
consult O
a B-KP
doctor I-KP
an O
almost O
lifelong O
custom O

Tesla O
did O
n't O
raise O
any O
question O
as O
to O
who O
was O
at O
fault O
and O
refused O
medical O
aid O

only O
asking O

Tesla O
was O
bedridden O
for O
some O
months O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
continue O
feeding O
pigeons O
from O
his O
window O
; O
soon O

In B-KP
early B-KP
1938 I-KP
, O
Tesla O
was O
able O
to O
get O
up O

He O
at O
once O
resumed O
the O
pigeon O

frequently O
had O
a O

Later O
in O

Tesla O
made O
claims O

after O
studying O
the B-KP
Van I-KP

The O
press O
variably O
referred O
to O
it O
as O
a O
`` O
peace O

'' O
or O
death B-KP

Tesla O
described O
the O

being O
used O
against O

or O
for O
anti B-KP

In B-KP
1937 B-KP
, O
at B-KP
a B-KP
luncheon I-KP
in I-KP
his I-KP
honor I-KP
concerning O
the O
death O

, O
Tesla O
stated O
, O
`` O
But O
it O

Computational B-KP
complexity I-KP
theory I-KP
is O
a O
branch O
of O
the O
theory O
of O
computation O
in O
theoretical O

science O
that O
focuses O
on O
classifying O
computational B-KP

according O
to O
their B-KP
inherent B-KP
difficulty I-KP
, O
and O
relating O
those O
classes O

each O
other O
. O

A B-KP
computational B-KP
problem I-KP
is O
understood O
to O
be O
a O
task O
that O
is O
in O
principle O
amenable O
to O
being O
solved O
by O
a O
computer O
, O
which O
is O
equivalent O
to O
stating O
that O
the O

be O
solved O
by O
mechanical O
application O

mathematical O
steps O
, O
such O
as O
an O
algorithm O
. O

A O
problem O
is O
regarded O

inherently O
difficult O
if B-KP
its I-KP

requires I-KP
significant I-KP
resources I-KP
, O
whatever O
the O

mathematical B-KP

to O
study O
these O

One O
of O
the O

A O
key O
distinction O
between O
analysis B-KP
of I-KP
algorithms I-KP
and O
computational B-KP
complexity I-KP
theory I-KP
is O
that O
the O
former O
is O
devoted O
to O
analyzing O
the O
amount O
of O
resources O
needed O
by O
a O
particular O
algorithm O
to O
solve O
a O
problem O
, O
whereas O
the O
latter O
asks O
a O
more O
general O
question O
about O
all O
possible O
algorithms O
that O
could O
be O
used O
to O
solve O
the O
same O
problem O
. O

More O
precisely O
, O
it O
tries O
to O
classify O
problems O
that O
can O
or O
can O
not O
be O
solved O
with O
appropriately O
restricted O
resources O
. O

In O
turn O
, O
imposing O
restrictions O
on O
the O
available O
resources O
is O
what O
distinguishes O
computational O
complexity O
from O
computability B-KP
theory I-KP
: O
the O
latter O
theory O
asks O
what O
kind O
of O
problems O
can O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
be O
solved O
algorithmically O
. O

A O
computational O
problem O
can O
be O
viewed O
as O
an O
infinite O
collection O
of O
instances B-KP
together O
with O
a O
solution B-KP
for O
every O
instance O
. O

The O
input O
string O
for O
a O
computational O
problem O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
a B-KP
problem B-KP
instance I-KP
, O
and O
should O
not O
be O
confused O
with O
the B-KP
problem I-KP
itself O
. O

In O
computational O
complexity O
theory O
, O
a B-KP
problem B-KP
refers O
to O
the O
abstract B-KP
question O
to O
be O
solved O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
an O
instance O
of O
this O
problem O
is O
a O
rather O
concrete B-KP
utterance O
, O
which O
can O
serve O
as O
the O
input O
for O
a O
decision O
problem O
. O

For O
example O
, O
consider O
the O
problem O
of O
primality O
testing O
. O

The O
instance O
is O
a O
number O
( O
e.g O
. O

15 O
) O
and O
the O
solution O
is O
`` O
yes O
'' O
if O
the O
number O
is O
prime O
and O
`` O
no O
'' O
otherwise O
( O
in O
this O
case O
`` O
no O
'' O
) O
. O

Stated O
another O
way O
, O
the B-KP
instance B-KP
is O
a O
particular O
input O
to O
the O
problem O
, O
and O
the B-KP
solution B-KP
is O
the O
output O
corresponding O
to O
the O
given O
input O
. O

To O
further O
highlight O
the O
difference O
between O
a O
problem O
and O
an O
instance O
, O
consider O
the O
following O
instance O
of O
the O
decision O
version O
of O
the O
traveling O
salesman O
problem O
: O
Is O
there O
a O
route O
of O
at O
most O
2000 B-KP
kilometres O
passing O
through O
all O
of O
Germany O

15 O
largest O
cities O
? O

The O
quantitative O
answer O
to O
this O
particular O
problem O
instance O
is O
of O
little O
use O
for O
solving O
other O
instances O
of O
the O
problem O
, O
such O
as O
asking B-KP
for I-KP
a B-KP
round I-KP
trip I-KP
through I-KP
all I-KP

in I-KP
Milan I-KP
whose I-KP
total I-KP

is I-KP
at I-KP
most I-KP
10 I-KP
km I-KP

For O
this O
reason O
, O
complexity O
theory O
addresses O
computational B-KP
problems I-KP
and O
not O
particular O
problem O
instances O
. O

When O
considering O
computational O
problems O
, O
a B-KP
problem B-KP
instance I-KP
is O
a O
string O
over O
an O
alphabet O

the O

taken O
to O

the O
binary B-KP
alphabet I-KP
( O
i.e. O
, O
the O
set O
{ O
0,1 O
} O
) O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
strings O
are O
bitstrings B-KP
. O

As O
in O
a O
real O
world O
computer O
, O
mathematical O
objects O
other O
than O
bitstrings O
must O
be O
suitably O
encoded O
. O

For O
example O
, O
integers O
can O
be O
represented O
in O
binary B-KP

can O
be O
encoded O

either O

or O
alternately O
either O

A O

be O
viewed O
as O
a O
formal O

where O
the O

the O
non O

those O

whether O

If O
the O

the O

otherwise O

A B-KP

Deciding O

ALL O

For O
the O

in O
this O
way O
, O
it O
is O
desirable O
to O
prove O
that O
relaxing O

defines O
a O

In O

it O
would O

For O

the O
answer O
to O
such O
questions O
is O
given O
by O
the O
time B-KP

theorems I-KP
respectively O
. O

They O
are O
called O
hierarchy O
theorems O
because O
they O
induce O
a B-KP
proper I-KP
hierarchy I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
classes I-KP
defined I-KP
by O
constraining O
the O

Thus O
there O
are O
pairs O
of O

such O
that O
one O

properly O

in O
the O
other O

Having O

we O
can O
proceed O

quantitative B-KP
statements I-KP

The B-KP

For O

us O
that O
P O

contained O
in O

tells O

that O

PSPACE B-KP

Many O
complexity O
classes O
are O
defined O
using O
the O
concept O
of O
a B-KP
reduction B-KP
. O

A O
reduction O
is O
a O
transformation O
of O
one O
problem O
into O
another B-KP
problem I-KP
. O

It O
captures O
the O
informal O
notion O
of O
a O
problem O
being O
at O
least O
as O
difficult O
as O
another O
problem O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if O
a O
problem O
X O
can O
be O
solved O
using O
an O
algorithm O
for O
Y O
, O
X O
is O
no O
more O
difficult O
than O
Y O
, O
and O
we O
say O
that O
X B-KP
reduces I-KP
to I-KP
Y I-KP
. O

There O
are O
many O
different O
types B-KP
of I-KP
reductions I-KP
, O
based O
on O
the O
method O
of O
reduction O
, O
such O
as O
Cook B-KP
reductions I-KP
, I-KP
Karp I-KP
reductions I-KP
and I-KP
Levin I-KP
reductions I-KP
, O
and O
the B-KP
bound I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
complexity I-KP
of I-KP
reductions I-KP
, O
such O
as O
polynomial O
time O
reductions O
or O
log O
space O
reductions O
. O

The O
most O
commonly O
used O
reduction O
is O
a O
polynomial B-KP
time I-KP
reduction I-KP
. O

This O
means O
that O
the O
reduction O
process O
takes O
polynomial B-KP
time I-KP
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
problem O
of O
squaring O
an O
integer O
can O
be O
reduced O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
multiplying B-KP
two I-KP
integers I-KP
. O

This O
means O
an O
algorithm O
for O
multiplying O
two O
integers O
can O
be O
used O
to O
square O
an O
integer O
. O

Indeed O
, O
this O
can O
be O
done O
by O
giving O
the O
same O
input B-KP
to O
both O
inputs O
of O
the O
multiplication B-KP
algorithm O
. O

Thus O
we O
see O
that O
squaring O
is O
not O
more O
difficult O
than O
multiplication O
, O
since O
squaring O
can O
be O
reduced O
to O
multiplication B-KP
. O

This O
motivates O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
problem O
being O
hard O
for O
a O
complexity O
class O
. O

A O
problem O
X O
is O
hard O
for O
a O
class O
of O
problems O
C O
if B-KP
every I-KP
problem I-KP
in I-KP
C I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
reduced I-KP
to I-KP
X I-KP
. O

Thus O
no O
problem B-KP
in I-KP
C I-KP
is I-KP
harder I-KP
than I-KP
X I-KP
, O
since O
an O
algorithm O
for O
X O
allows O
us O
to O
solve B-KP
any I-KP
problem I-KP
in I-KP
C. I-KP
Of O
course O
, O
the O
notion O
of O
hard O
problems O
depends O
on O
the B-KP
type I-KP
of I-KP
reduction I-KP
being I-KP
used I-KP
. O

For O
complexity O
classes O
larger O
than O
P O
, O
polynomial O
time O
reductions O
are O
commonly O
used O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
set O
of O
problems O
that O
are O
hard O
for O
NP O
is O
the O
set O
of O
NP B-KP
hard I-KP
problems I-KP
. O

If O
a O
problem O
X O
is O
in O
C O
and O
hard O
for O
C O
, O
then O
X O
is O
said O
to O
be O
complete O
for O
C. O
This O
means O
that O
X O
is O
the O
hardest O
problem O
in O
C. O
( O
Since O
many O
problems O
could O
be O
equally O
hard O
, O
one O
might O
say O
that O
X O
is O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
problems O
in O
C. O
) O
Thus O
the O
class O
of O
NP B-KP
complete I-KP

contains O
the O
most O
difficult O
problems O
in O
NP O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
they O
are O
the O
ones O
most O
likely O
not O
to O
be O
in O
P. B-KP
Because O
the O
problem O

reduce O
a O
known O
NP O

problem O
, O
2 O
, O
to O
another O
problem O
, O

, O
would O
indicate O
that O
there B-KP
is I-KP
no I-KP
known I-KP
polynomial I-KP

for O
1 O
. O

This O
is O
because O
a O
polynomial O
time O
solution O
to O
1 O
would O
yield O
a O
polynomial O
time O

to O
2 O
. O

Similarly O
, O
because O
all O

can O
be O
reduced O
to O
the O
set O
, O
finding O
an O
NP O
complete O
problem O
that O

be O

in O

would O
mean O
that O
P O

in O
that O

somewhat O

What O

open O

Saying O
that O

also O
involve O
assessing O
the O

levels O

students O
on O
particular B-KP
skills I-KP

Understanding O
the O
pedagogy O
of O
the O
students O
in O
a O
classroom B-KP
involves O
using O
differentiated O
instruction O
as O
well O
as O
supervision O
to O
meet O
the O
needs O
of O
all O
students O
in O
the O
classroom O
. O

Pedagogy O
can O
be O
thought O
of O
in O
two O
manners O
. O

First O
, O
teaching O
itself O
can O
be O
taught O
in O
many O
different O
ways O
, O
hence O
, O
using O
a O
pedagogy O
of O
teaching O
styles O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
pedagogy O
of O
the O
learners O
comes O
into O
play O
when O
a O
teacher O
assesses O
the O
pedagogic O
diversity O
of O
his/her O
students O
and O
differentiates O
for O
the O
individual O
students O
accordingly O
. O

For O
example O
, O
an O
experienced O
teacher O
and O
parent O
described O
the O
place O
of O
a O
teacher O
in O
learning O
as O
follows O
: O
`` O
The O
real O
bulk O
of O
learning O
takes O
place O
in B-KP
self I-KP
study I-KP
and I-KP
problem I-KP
solving I-KP
with O
a O
lot O
of O
feedback O
around O
that O
loop O
. O

The O
function O
of O
the O
teacher O
is O
to O
pressure O
the O
lazy O
, O
inspire O
the O
bored O
, O
deflate B-KP
the O
cocky O
, O
encourage B-KP
the O
timid O
, O
detect O
and O
correct O
individual O
flaws O
, O
and O
broaden O
the O
viewpoint O
of O
all O
. O

This O
function O
looks O
like O
that O
of O
a B-KP
coach B-KP
using O
the O
whole O
gamut O
of O
psychology O
to O
get O
each O
new O
class O
of O
rookies O
off O
the O
bench O
and O
into O
the O
game O
. O
'' O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
significant O
difference O
between O
primary B-KP
school I-KP
and O
secondary O
school O
teaching O
is O
the B-KP
relationship I-KP
between I-KP
teachers B-KP
and I-KP
children I-KP
. I-KP

In O
primary O
schools O
each O
class O
has O
a O
teacher O
who O
stays O
with O
them O
for O
most O
of O
the O
week O
and O
will O
teach O
them O
the B-KP
whole I-KP
curriculum I-KP
. O

In O
secondary O
schools O
they O
will O
be O
taught O
by O
different B-KP
subject B-KP
specialists I-KP
each O
session O
during O
the O
week O
and O
may O
have O
ten O
or O
more O
different O
teachers O
. O

The O
relationship O
between O
children O
and O
their O
teachers O
tends O
to O
be O
closer O
in O
the O
primary B-KP
school I-KP
where O
they O
act O
as O
form O
tutor O
, O
specialist O
teacher O
and O
surrogate B-KP
parent O
during O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
. O

This O
is O
true O
throughout O
most O
of O
the O
United B-KP
States I-KP
as O
well O
. O

However O
, O
alternative B-KP
approaches O
for O
primary O
education O
do O
exist O
. O

One O
of O
these O
, O
sometimes O
referred O
to O
as O
a O
`` O
platoon B-KP
'' I-KP
system I-KP
, O
involves O
placing O
a O
group O
of O
students O
together O
in O
one O
class O
that O
moves O
from O
one O
specialist O
to O
another O
for O
every O
subject O
. O

The O
advantage O
here O
is O
that O
students O
learn O
from O
teachers O
who O
specialize O
in O
one O
subject O
and O
who O
tend O
to O
be O
more O
knowledgeable B-KP
in O
that O
one O
area O
than O
a O
teacher O
who O
teaches O
many O
subjects O
. O

Students O
still O
derive O
a O
strong O
sense O
of O
security O
by B-KP
staying I-KP
with I-KP
the I-KP
same I-KP
group I-KP
of I-KP
peers I-KP
for I-KP
all I-KP
classes I-KP
. O

Co B-KP
teaching I-KP
has O
also O
become O
a O
new O
trend O
amongst O
educational O
institutions O
. O

Co O
teaching O
is O
defined O
as O
two B-KP
or I-KP
more I-KP
teachers O
working O
harmoniously B-KP
to O
fulfill O
the O
needs O
of O
every O
student O
in O
the O

Co O
teaching O
focuses O
the O
student O
on O
learning B-KP
by O
providing O
a O
social B-KP
networking I-KP
support I-KP
that O
allows O
them O
to O
reach O
their O
full O
cognitive O
potential O
. O

Co O
teachers O
work O
in B-KP
sync I-KP
with O
one O
another O
to O
create O
a O
climate O

learning O
. O

Throughout O
the O
history O
of O

the B-KP
most B-KP
common I-KP
form O
of O

was O

While B-KP

Primarily O
because O
rules O

are O
made O
by O
the O

thence O
the O

one O
of O

rather O
than O

that O

fairly O

Since O
teachers O
can O
affect O
how O
students O
perceive O
the O
course O
materials O
, O
it O
has O
been O
found O
that O
teachers O
who O
showed O
enthusiasm B-KP

the O
course O

can O
affect O
a O
positive O

. O

On O
teacher/course O
evaluations O
, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
teachers O
who O
have O
a O
positive O
disposition O
towards O
the O
course O
content O
tend O
to O
transfer O
their O
passion B-KP

receptive O
students O

These O
teachers O
do O
not O
teach B-KP

attempt O
to O
find O
new O
invigoration O
for O
the O
course O

on O
a O
daily O
basis O
. O

One O
of O
the O
difficulties O
in O
this O
approach O
is O
that O
teachers O
may O
have O
repeatedly O
covered O
a O
curriculum O
until O
they O
begin O
to O
feel O
bored O
with O
the O
subject O
which O
in O
turn O
bores O
the O
students O
as O
well O
. O

Students O
who O
had O
enthusiastic O

tend O
to O
rate O

higher B-KP

teachers I-KP
who I-KP
did I-KP
n't I-KP
show I-KP
much I-KP
enthusiasm I-KP

the O

Teachers O
that O
exhibit O

lead O

students O

are O
more O
likely O

engaged O
, O
interested O

energetic O

and O
curious O
about O

Recent O

teacher B-KP

result O
in O

intrinsic O

Students O
who O

very O
enthusiastic O
teacher O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
read B-KP
lecture I-KP
material I-KP
outside O
of O
the O

There O
are O
various O
mechanisms O
by O
which O
teacher O
enthusiasm B-KP
may O
facilitate O
higher O
levels O
of O
intrinsic O
motivation O
. O

Teacher B-KP
enthusiasm I-KP
may O
contribute O
to O
a O
classroom O
atmosphere O
full O
of O
energy O
and O
enthusiasm O
which O
feed O
student O
interest O
and O
excitement B-KP
in O
learning O
the O
subject O

. O

Enthusiastic O
teachers O
may O
also O
lead O
to O
students O
becoming O
more O
self B-KP
determined I-KP
in O
their O
own O
learning O
process O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
mere O
exposure O
indicates O
that O
the O
teacher O
's O
enthusiasm O
may O
contribute O
to O
the O
student O
's O
expectations O
about O
intrinsic O
motivation O
in O
the O
context O
of O
learning O
. O

Also O
, O
enthusiasm B-KP
may O
act O
as O
a O
`` O
motivational O
embellishment O
'' O
; O
increasing O
a O
student O
's O
interest O
by O
the O
variety O
, O
novelty O
, O
and O
surprise O
of O
the O
enthusiastic O
teacher O
's O
presentation O
of O
the O
material O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
concept O
of O
emotional B-KP
contagion I-KP
, O
may O
also O
apply O
. O

Students O
may O
become O
more O
intrinsically O

the O
enthusiasm O

energy O
of O
the O

If O
they O
do O

enjoy O
what O
they O
are O
doing O

the O

their O
students O
is O
going O
to O
help O
that O
individual O
succeed O

their O
life O
in O
the O
future O

The O
teacher O
also O
needs O
to O
be O
enthusiastic B-KP
about O
the O
subject O
matter O
they O
are O
teaching O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
teacher O
talking O

needs O
to O
enjoy O
the O
art O
of O

and O
show O
that O

their O

A O
spark O
in O
the O
teacher O

a O
spark O
of O
excitement O
in B-KP
the I-KP
student B-KP

well O
. O

An O
enthusiastic B-KP
teacher O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
be O
very B-KP
influential B-KP
in O
the O
young O
students O
life O
. O

Misconduct O
by O
teachers O
, O
especially O
sexual B-KP

has O
been O
getting O
increased O
scrutiny O

the O

the O
American B-KP

In O
keeping O

nature O
of O
most O
Protestant B-KP

the O

The O

The O
emphasis O

similar O
to O
that O
in O
the O
more O
`` O

with O
a O
stronger O

Further O
, O
additional O
spiritual O
guidance O
is O
offered O
by O
those O
holding O
the O
office O

notes O
that O
Luther O

was O
determined O
to O
see O
Martin O

He O
sent O
Martin O

Magdeburg O

: O

Luther O
later O
compared O
his O
education O
there O
to O
purgatory O

In O
1501 O
, O
at O
the O
age O
of O
19 O
, O
he O
entered O
the O
University B-KP

he O
later O
described O
as O
a O

He O
was O
made O

degree O
in O

In O
accordance O
with O
his O
father O

wishes O
, O
Luther O
enrolled O
in O
law B-KP
school O
at O
the O
same O
university O
that O
year O
but O
dropped O
out O
almost O
immediately O
, O
believing O
that O
law O
represented O
uncertainty B-KP

Luther O
sought O
assurances O
about O
life O
and O
was O
drawn O
to O
theology B-KP

philosophy I-KP
, O
expressing O
particular O
interest O
in O
Aristotle O
, O
William O
of O
Ockham O

Gabriel O

He O
was O
deeply O
influenced O
by O
two O
tutors O
, O
Bartholomaeus O
Arnoldi O
von O
Usingen O
and O
Jodocus O
Trutfetter O
, O
who O
taught O
him O
to O
be O
suspicious O
of O
even O
the O
greatest O
thinkers O
and O
to O
test O
everything O
himself O
by B-KP
experience B-KP
. O

Philosophy O
proved O
to O
be O
unsatisfying O
, O
offering O
assurance O
about O
the O
use O
of O
reason O
but O
none O
about O
loving O
God O
, O
which O
to O
Luther O
was O
more O
important O
. O

Reason O
could O
not O
lead O
men O
to O
God O
, O
he O
felt O
, O
and O
he O
thereafter O
developed O
a O
love O
hate O
relationship O
with O
Aristotle O
over O
the O
latter O

emphasis O
on O
reason O

For O
Luther O
, O
reason O
could O
be O
used O
to O
question O
men O

but O
not O
God B-KP

Human O
beings O
could O
learn O
about O

only O

, O
he O
believed O

and O
Scripture O
therefore O
became O
increasingly O
important O
to O
him O

He O
later O
attributed O
his O
decision O
to O
an O
event O
: O
on O
2 B-KP

he O
was O
returning O

a O
trip O
home O

During O
a O
thunderstorm O

a O
lightning O

struck O

him O

Later O
telling O
his O
father O
he O
was O
terrified O
of O
death B-KP

divine I-KP
judgment I-KP

he O
cried O
out O
, O
`` O
Help O

Saint O
Anna O
, O
I O
will O
become O
a O
monk O

'' O

He O
came O
to O
view O
his O
cry O
for O
help O
as O
a O
vow O
he O
could O
never O
break O

He O
left O

Hans B-KP
Hillerbrand B-KP
writes O
that O

had O
no O

Luther B-KP
objected O

a O
saying O
attributed O
to O
Johann B-KP
Tetzel B-KP
that O
`` O

He O
insisted O
that O
, O
since O

alone O
to O

those O
who O
claimed O
that O

such O
false B-KP

However O
, O
this O
oft O

Tetzel B-KP
was O
by O
no O
means O
representative O
of O
contemporary O

rather O
a O
reflection O

the I-KP
dead I-KP

his O

short O
commentary O

Work O

This O
early B-KP
part I-KP

career O
was O
one O
of O
his O
most O
creative O
and O
productive O

From O
1510 O
to O
1520 O
, O
Luther O
lectured B-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
Psalms I-KP
, O
the O
books O
of O
Hebrews O
, O
Romans O
, O
and O
Galatians O
. O

As O
he O
studied O
these O
portions O
of O
the O
Bible O
, O
he O
came O
to O
view O
the O
use O
of O
terms O
such O
as O
penance B-KP
and I-KP
righteousness I-KP
by O
the O
Catholic O
Church O
in O
new O
ways O
. O

He O
became O
convinced O
that O
the O
church O
was O
corrupt B-KP
in I-KP
its I-KP
ways I-KP
and O
had O
lost O
sight O
of O
what O
he O
saw O
as O
several B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
central I-KP
truths I-KP
of I-KP
Christianity I-KP
. O

The O
most O
important O
for O
Luther O
was O
the O
doctrine B-KP
of I-KP
justification I-KP
God O
's O
act O
of O
declaring O
a O
sinner O
righteous O
by O
faith O
alone O
through O
God O
's O
grace O
. O

He O
began O
to O
teach O
that O
salvation B-KP
or I-KP
redemption I-KP
is I-KP
a I-KP
gift I-KP
of I-KP
God I-KP
's I-KP
grace I-KP
, I-KP
attainable I-KP
only I-KP
through I-KP
faith I-KP
in I-KP
Jesus I-KP
as I-KP
the I-KP
Messiah I-KP
. O

`` O
This O
one O
and O
firm O
rock O
, O
which O
we O
call O
the O
doctrine B-KP
of I-KP
justification I-KP
, O
'' O
he O
wrote O
, O
`` O
is O
the O
chief O
article O
of O
the O
whole O
Christian O
doctrine O
, O
which O
comprehends O
the O
understanding O
of O
all O
godliness O
. O
'' O

Luther O
came O
to O
understand O
justification O
as O
entirely O
the O
work O
of O
God B-KP
. O

This O
teaching O
by O
Luther O
was O
clearly O
expressed O
in O
his O
1525 B-KP
publication O
On O
the O
Bondage O
of O
the O
Will O
, O
which O
was O
written O
in O
response O
to O
On O
Free O
Will O
by O
Desiderius O
Erasmus O
( O
1524 O
) O
. O

Luther O
based O
his O
position O
on O
predestination O
on O
St. O
Paul O
's O
epistle O
to O
the O
Ephesians O
2:8 O
10 O
. O

Against O
the O
teaching O
of O
his O
day O
that O
the O
righteous O
acts O
of O
believers O
are O
performed O
in O
cooperation O
with O
God O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
that O
Christians O
receive O
such O
righteousness O
entirely O
from O
outside O
themselves O
; O
that O
righteousness O
not O
only O
comes O
from O
Christ O
but O
actually O
is O
the O
righteousness O
of O
Christ O
, O
imputed O
to O
Christians O
( O
rather O
than O
infused O
into O
them O
) O
through O
faith O
. O

`` O
That O
is O
why O
faith O
alone O
makes O
someone O
just O
and O
fulfills O
the O
law O
, O
'' O
he O
wrote O
. O

`` O
Faith B-KP
is I-KP
that I-KP
which I-KP
brings I-KP
the I-KP
Holy I-KP
Spirit I-KP
through I-KP
the I-KP
merits I-KP
of I-KP
Christ I-KP
. O
'' O

Faith O
, O
for O
Luther O
, O
was O
a O
gift B-KP
from I-KP
God I-KP
; O
the O
experience O
of O
being O
justified O
by O
faith O
was O
`` O
as O
though O
I O
had O
been O
born O
again O
. O
'' O

His O
entry O
into O
Paradise O
, O
no O
less O
, O
was O
a O
discovery O
about O
`` O
the O
righteousness O
of O
God O
'' O
a O
discovery O
that O
`` O
the O
just O
person O
'' O
of O
whom O
the O
Bible O
speaks O
( O
as O
in O
Romans O
1:17 O
) O
lives B-KP
by I-KP
faith B-KP
. O

He O
explained O
his O
concept O
of O
`` O
justification O
'' O
in O
the B-KP
Smalcald B-KP
Articles I-KP
: O

Luther O
's O
rediscovery B-KP
of I-KP
`` I-KP
Christ B-KP
and I-KP
His I-KP
salvation I-KP
'' I-KP
was O
the O
first O
of O
two B-KP
points I-KP
that O
became O
the O
foundation O
for O
the O
Reformation O
. O

His O
railing O
against O
the O
sale B-KP
of I-KP
indulgences I-KP
was O
based O
on O
it O
. O

Archbishop B-KP
Albrecht I-KP
of I-KP
Mainz I-KP
and I-KP
Magdeburg I-KP
did O
not O
reply O
to O
Luther O
's O
letter O
containing O
the O
95 O
Theses O
. O

He O
had O
the O
theses O
checked O
for O
heresy O
and O
in O
December B-KP
1517 B-KP
forwarded O
them O
to O
Rome B-KP
. O

He O
needed O
the O
revenue O
from O
the O
indulgences O
to O
pay B-KP
off I-KP
a I-KP
papal I-KP
dispensation I-KP
for I-KP
his I-KP
tenure I-KP
of O
more O
than O
one O
bishopric O
. O

As O
Luther O
later O
noted O
, O
`` O
the O
pope O
had O
a O
finger O
in O
the O
pie O
as O
well O
, O
because O
one B-KP
half B-KP
was O
to O
go O
to O
the O
building O
of O
St O
Peter O
's O
Church O
in O
Rome O
'' O
. O

Pope B-KP
Leo B-KP
X I-KP
was O
used O
to O
reformers O
and O
heretics O
, O
and O
he O
responded O
slowly O
, O
`` O
with O
great O
care O
as O
is O
proper O
. O
'' O

Over O
the O
next O
three O
years O
he O
deployed O
a O
series O
of O
papal B-KP
theologians I-KP
and I-KP
envoys I-KP
against O
Luther O
, O
which O
served O
only O
to O
harden O
the O
reformer O
's O
anti O
papal O
theology O
. O

First O
, O
the O
Dominican O
theologian O
Sylvester O
Mazzolini O
drafted O
a O
heresy O
case O
against O
Luther O
, O
whom O
Leo O
then O
summoned O
to O
Rome O
. O

The O
Elector O
Frederick O
persuaded O
the O
pope O
to O
have O
Luther O
examined O
at O
Augsburg O
, O
where O
the O
Imperial O
Diet O
was O
held O
. O

There O
, O
in O
October B-KP
1518 B-KP
, O
under O
questioning O
by O
papal O
legate O
Cardinal O
Cajetan O
Luther O
stated O
that O
he O
did O
not O
consider O
the O
papacy O
part O
of O
the O
biblical O
Church O
because O
historistical O
interpretation O
of O
Bible O
prophecy O
concluded O
that O
the O
papacy B-KP
was I-KP
the I-KP
Antichrist I-KP
. O

The O
prophecies O
concerning O
the O
Antichrist O
soon O
became O
the O
center O
of O
controversy O
. O

The O
hearings O
degenerated O
into O
a O
shouting O
match O
. O

More O
than O
his O
writing O
the O
95 O
Theses O
, O
Luther O
's O
confrontation O
with O
the O
church O
cast O
him O
as O
an O
enemy O
of O
the O
pope O
. O

Cajetan O
's O
original O
instructions O
had O
been O
to B-KP
arrest B-KP
Luther I-KP
if O
he O
failed O
to O
recant O
, O
but O
the O
legate O
desisted O
from O
doing O
so O
. O

Luther O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
city O
at O
night O
, O
unbeknownst O
to O
Cajetan O
. O

In O
January B-KP
1519 B-KP
, O
at O
Altenburg O
in O
Saxony O
, O
the O
papal O
nuncio O
Karl O
von O
Miltitz O
adopted O
a O
more O
conciliatory O
approach O
. O

Luther O
made O
certain O
concessions O
to O
the O
Saxon O
, O
who O
was O
a O
relative O
of O
the O
Elector O
, O
and O
promised O
to O
remain B-KP
silent I-KP
if I-KP
his I-KP
opponents I-KP
did I-KP
. O

The O
theologian O
Johann B-KP
Eck B-KP
, O
however O
, O
was O
determined O
to O
expose O
Luther O
's O
doctrine O
in O
a O
public O
forum O
. O

In O
June O
and O
July O
1519 O
, O
he O
staged O
a O
disputation O
with O
Luther O
's O
colleague O
Andreas O
Karlstadt O
at O
Leipzig O
and O
invited O
Luther O
to O
speak O
. O

Luther O
's O
boldest O
assertion O
in O
the O
debate O
was O
that O
Matthew B-KP
16:18 I-KP
does O
not O
confer O
on O
popes O
the O
exclusive O
right O
to O
interpret O
scripture O
, O
and O
that O
therefore O
neither O
popes O
nor O
church O
councils O
were O
infallible O

For O
this O
, O
Eck O
branded O

Johann B-KP

speaking O
on O

of O
the O
Empire O
as O
assistant O
of O
the O
Archbishop B-KP

Trier I-KP
, O
presented O
Luther O
with O
copies O

out O
on O

asked O
him O
if O
the O

his O

whether B-KP
he I-KP
stood I-KP
by I-KP
their I-KP
contents I-KP

Luther O
confirmed B-KP
he O
was O
their O
author O
, O
but O
requested O
time O
to O
think O
about O
the O
answer O
to O
the O
second O
question O

He O
prayed O
, O
consulted O
friends O

gave O
his O
response O
the B-KP
next I-KP
day I-KP
: I-KP

At O
the O
end O
of O
this O
speech O
, O
Luther O
raised B-KP
his I-KP
arm I-KP
`` O

Michael B-KP
Mullett I-KP
considers O
this O

a O
`` O

Luther B-KP
refused O
to O

his I-KP

He O
is O
sometimes O

quoted O
as O
saying O
: O
`` O
Here O

I O

do O
no O

'' O
. O

Recent O
scholars O
consider O
the O
evidence O
for O
these O
words O
to O
be O
unreliable O
, O
since O
they O
were O
inserted O
before O
`` O
May O
God O

me O
'' O
only O
in O
later O
versions O
of O
the O
speech O

not B-KP
recorded I-KP

accounts I-KP

the O

However O
, O
Mullett O
suggests O
that O
given O
his O
nature O
, O
`` O
we O
are O
free O
to O
believe O
that O
Luther O
would O
tend O
to O

Over O

Luther B-KP

disappearance B-KP

They O
escorted O
Luther O
to O
the O
security O
of O
the O
Wartburg B-KP
Castle I-KP
at O
Eisenach O
. O

During O
his O
stay O
at O
Wartburg O
, O
which O
he O
referred O
to O
as O
`` O
my B-KP
Patmos I-KP
'' O
, O
Luther O
translated O
the O
New B-KP
Testament I-KP
from O
Greek O
into O
German O
and O
poured O
out O
doctrinal O
and O
polemical O
writings O
. O

These O
included O
a O
renewed O
attack O
on O
Archbishop O
Albrecht O
of O
Mainz O
, O
whom O
he O
shamed B-KP
into O
halting O
the O
sale O

his O
episcopates O

a O
`` O

expounded O
the O

Jacobus O
Latomus O

an O
orthodox O
theologian O
from O
Louvain O
. O

In O
this O
work O
, O
one O
of O
his O
most O
emphatic O
statements O
on O
faith O
, O
he O
argued O
that O
every O
good O
work O
designed O
to O
attract O
God O
's O
favor O
is O
a B-KP
sin B-KP
. O

All B-KP
humans I-KP
are I-KP
sinners I-KP
by I-KP

explained I-KP

( I-KP

just I-KP

On O
1 B-KP
August I-KP
1521 B-KP
, O
Luther O
wrote O
to O
Melanchthon O
on O
the O
same O
theme O
: O
`` O
Be O
a O
sinner O
, O
and O
let O
your O
sins O
be O
strong O

let O
your O

rejoice O
in O
Christ O
who O
is O
the O
victor O
over O

the O
world O

We O
will O
commit O

are O
here O

where O
justice B-KP
resides O
. O
'' O

In O
the O
summer B-KP
of I-KP
1521 B-KP
, O
Luther O
widened O
his O
target O
from O
individual O
pieties O
like O
indulgences O
and O
pilgrimages O
to O
doctrines O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
Church O
practices O
. O

In O
On O
the O
Abrogation O
of O
the O
Private O
Mass O
, O
he O
condemned B-KP
as I-KP
idolatry B-KP
the O
idea O
that O
the O
mass O
is O
a O
sacrifice O
, O
asserting O
instead O
that O
it O
is O
a B-KP
gift B-KP
, O
to O
be O
received O
with O
thanksgiving O
by O
the O
whole O
congregation O
. O

His O
essay O
On O
Confession O
, O
Whether O
the O
Pope O
has O
the O
Power O
to O
Require O
It O
rejected O
compulsory O
confession O
and O
encouraged O
private B-KP
confession I-KP

absolution I-KP
, O
since O
`` O
every O
Christian O
is O
a O
confessor O

'' O

In O
November O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
The O
Judgement O
of O
Martin O
Luther O
on O
Monastic O
Vows O
. O

He O
assured O
monks O
and O
nuns O
that O
they O
could O
break B-KP
their I-KP
vows I-KP
without I-KP
sin I-KP
, I-KP
because O
vows O
were O
an O
illegitimate B-KP
and O
vain O
attempt O
to O
win O
salvation O
. O

In O
1521 B-KP
Luther O
dealt O
largely O
with O
prophecy B-KP
, O
in O
which O
he O
broadened O
the O
foundations O
of O
the O
Reformation O
placing B-KP
them I-KP
on I-KP
prophetic I-KP
faith I-KP
. I-KP

His O
main O
interest O
was O
centered O
on O
the O
prophecy B-KP
of I-KP
the B-KP
Little B-KP
Horn I-KP
in O
Daniel B-KP
8:9 I-KP
12 I-KP

The B-KP

identified O

the O
power O

Daniel O

, O
coming O
up O
among O
the O
divisions O
of O
Rome O

Luther O
made O
his O
pronouncements O
from O
Wartburg O
in O
the O
context O
of O
rapid O
developments O
at O
Wittenberg O
, O
of O
which O
he O
was O
kept O
fully O
informed O
. O

Andreas O
Karlstadt O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
ex O
Augustinian O
Gabriel B-KP
Zwilling I-KP
, O
embarked O
on O
a O
radical O
programme O
of O
reform O
there O
in O
June B-KP
1521 B-KP
, O
exceeding O
anything O
envisaged O
by O
Luther O
. O

The O
reforms O
provoked O
disturbances B-KP
, O
including O
a O
revolt O
by O
the O
Augustinian B-KP
friars I-KP
against O
their O
prior O
, O
the O
smashing O
of O
statues O
and O
images O
in O
churches O
, O
and O
denunciations O
of O
the O
magistracy O
. O

After O
secretly O
visiting O
Wittenberg O
in O
early O
December O
1521 O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
A O
Sincere O
Admonition O
by O
Martin O
Luther O
to O
All O
Christians O
to O
Guard O
Against O
Insurrection O
and O
Rebellion O
. O

Wittenberg O
became O
even O
more O
volatile O
after O
Christmas O
when O
a O
band O
of O
visionary O
zealots O
, O
the O
so O
called O
Zwickau B-KP
prophets I-KP
, O
arrived O
, O
preaching O
revolutionary O
doctrines O
such O
as O
the O
equality O
of O
man O
, O
adult O
baptism O
, O
and O
Christ O
's O
imminent O
return O
. O

When O
the B-KP
town B-KP
council I-KP
asked O
Luther O
to O
return O
, O
he O
decided O
it O
was O
his O
duty O
to O
act O
. O

Luther O
secretly O
returned O
to O
Wittenberg O
on O
6 B-KP
March I-KP
1522 I-KP
. O

He O
wrote O
to O
the O
Elector O
: O
`` O
During O
my O
absence O
, O
Satan O
has O
entered O
my O
sheepfold O
, O
and O
committed O

I O

not O
repair O

only O
by O
my O
personal B-KP

For O
eight O
days O
in O
Lent O
, O
beginning O
on O
Invocavit O
Sunday O
, O
9 O
March O
, O
Luther O
preached B-KP
eight I-KP
sermons I-KP
, O
which O
became O
known O
as O
the O
`` O
Invocavit B-KP
Sermons I-KP
'' O
. O

In O
these O
sermons O
, O
he O
hammered O
home O
the O
primacy O
of O
core O
Christian O
values O
such O
as O
love B-KP
, I-KP
patience I-KP
, I-KP
charity I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
freedom I-KP
, O
and O
reminded O
the O
citizens O
to O
trust B-KP
God I-KP
's I-KP
word I-KP
rather O
than O
violence O
to O
bring O
about O
necessary O
change O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
Luther O
's O
intervention O
was O
immediate B-KP
. O

After B-KP
the I-KP
sixth I-KP
sermon I-KP
, O
the O
Wittenberg O
jurist O
Jerome B-KP
Schurf B-KP
wrote O
to O
the O
elector O
: O
`` O
Oh O
, O
what O
joy B-KP

Dr. O
Martin O

return O
spread O
among O
us O

His O
words O

through O
divine O

are O
bringing O
back O
every O
day O
misguided B-KP
people O
into O
the O
way O
of O
the O
truth O

'' O

Luther O
next O
set O
about O
reversing O
or O
modifying O
the O
new O
church O
practices O
. O

By O
working O
alongside O
the O
authorities O
to O
restore O
public B-KP
order I-KP
, I-KP
he O
signalled O
his O
reinvention B-KP
as I-KP
a I-KP
conservative I-KP
force O
within O
the O
Reformation O
. O

After O
banishing O
the O
Zwickau B-KP
prophets I-KP
, O
he O
now O
faced O
a O
battle O
against O
not O
only O
the B-KP
established B-KP
Church I-KP
but O
also O
the O
radical O
reformers O
who O
threatened O
the O
new O
order O
by O
fomenting O
social B-KP
unrest I-KP
and I-KP
violence I-KP
. I-KP

Despite O
his O
victory O
in O
Wittenberg O
, O
Luther O
was O
unable O
to O
stifle O
radicalism O
further O
afield O
. O

Preachers B-KP
such O
as O
Zwickau B-KP

Nicholas O
Storch O

There O
had O
been O

the O

the O
15th O
century O

Luther O

pamphlets O
against O
the O
Church O
and O
the O
hierarchy O
, O
often O
worded O
with O
`` O
liberal O
'' O
phraseology O
, O
now O
led O
many O
peasants O
to O
believe O
he O
would O
support B-KP
an I-KP
attack I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
upper B-KP
classes I-KP

broke O
out O

Luther O
sympathised O
with O
some O
of O
the O
peasants O
' O
grievances O

as O
he O
showed O
in O
his O
response O
to O
the O
Twelve O
Articles O
in O
May O
1525 O
, O
but O
he O
reminded O
the O
aggrieved O
to O
obey O
the O
temporal B-KP
authorities I-KP

During O
a O
tour B-KP
of I-KP
Thuringia B-KP

First O

to O
`` O

Lastly O
, O
Luther O
charged O
the O

with O

themselves O
`` O

and O
committing O
their O
sinful O

Without O
Luther O

the I-KP

, O
many O
rebels O
laid O
down O
their O

Thereafter O
, O
radicalism O
found O
a O
refuge O
in O
the O
anabaptist O
movement O

other O
religious O
movements O
, O
while O

under O

Martin O

`` O

At O

Katharina O

Andreas O

Luther O

the O
seal B-KP

clerical B-KP

He O
had O
long O
condemned O
vows O
of O
celibacy O
on B-KP
Biblical B-KP
grounds I-KP

his O
decision O
to O

surprised O
many O
, O
not O

Melanchthon O

who O
called O
it O
reckless B-KP

Luther O
had O
written O
to O
George O

on O
30 O
November O
1524 O
, O
`` O
I O

'' O

Before O
marrying O
, O
Luther O
had O
been O
living O
on O
the O
plainest O
food O

, O
as O
he O
admitted O
himself O

his O

Luther O
confided O
to O
Michael O
Stiefel O
on O
11 O
August O
1526 O
: O
`` O
My O
Katie O
is O
in O
all O

that O
I O

not O

the I-KP

of I-KP
Croesus I-KP
. I-KP
'' O

By O
1526 O
, O
Luther O
found O
himself O
increasingly O
occupied O
in O
organising O
a O
new O
church O
. O

His O
Biblical O
ideal O
of O
congregations O
' O
choosing B-KP
their I-KP
own I-KP
ministers I-KP
had O
proved O
unworkable O
. O

According O
to O
Bainton O
: O
`` O
Luther O
's O
dilemma O
was O
that O
he O
wanted O
both O
a O
confessional B-KP
church I-KP
based I-KP
on I-KP
personal I-KP
faith I-KP
and I-KP
experience I-KP
and I-KP
a I-KP
territorial I-KP
church I-KP
including I-KP
all I-KP
in I-KP
a I-KP
given I-KP
locality I-KP
. O

If O
he O
were O
forced O
to O
choose O
, O
he O
would O
take O
his O
stand O
with O
the O
masses O
, O
and O
this O
was O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
he O
moved O
. O
'' O

From O
1525 O
to O
1529 O
, O
he O
established O
a O
supervisory B-KP
church I-KP
body I-KP
, O
laid O
down O
a B-KP
new I-KP
form I-KP
of O
worship O
service O
, O
and O
wrote O
a O
clear O
summary O
of O
the O
new O
faith O
in O
the O
form O
of O
two B-KP
catechisms I-KP
. I-KP

Luther O
's O
thought O
is O
revolutionary B-KP
to O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
is O
a O
theology B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
cross I-KP
, I-KP
the O
negation O
of O
every O
affirmation O
: O
as O
long O
as O
the O
cross O
is O
at O
the O
center O
, O
the O
system O
building O
tendency O
of O
reason O
is O
held O
in O
check O
, O
and O
system O
building O
does O
not O
degenerate O
into O
System O
. O

To O
avoid O
confusing O
or O
upsetting O
the O
people O
, O
Luther O
avoided O
extreme B-KP
change I-KP
. I-KP

He O
also O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
replace O
one O
controlling O
system O
with O
another O
. O

He O
concentrated O
on O
the O
church O
in O
the O
Electorate B-KP
of I-KP
Saxony I-KP
, O
acting O
only O
as O
an O
adviser B-KP
to O
churches O
in O
new O
territories O
, O
many O
of O
which O
followed O
his O
Saxon O
model O
. O

He O
worked O
closely O
with O
the O
new O
elector O
, O
John B-KP
the I-KP
Steadfast I-KP
, I-KP
to O
whom O
he O
turned O
for O
secular O
leadership O
and O
funds O
on O
behalf O
of O
a O
church O
largely O
shorn O
of O
its O
assets O
and O
income O
after O
the O
break O
with O
Rome O
. O

For O
Luther O
's O
biographer O
Martin O
Brecht O
, O
this O
partnership O
`` O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
questionable O
and O
originally O
unintended O
development O
towards O
a O
church B-KP
government I-KP
under I-KP
the I-KP
temporal I-KP
sovereign I-KP
'' O
. O

The O
elector O
authorised O
a O
visitation O
of O
the O
church O
, O
a O
power O
formerly O
exercised O
by O
bishops O
. O

At O
times O
, O
Luther O
's O
practical O
reforms O
fell O
short O
of O
his O
earlier O
radical O
pronouncements O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
Instructions O
for O
the O
Visitors O
of O
Parish O
Pastors O
in O
Electoral O
Saxony O
( O
1528 O
) O
, O
drafted O
by O
Melanchthon O
with O
Luther O
's O
approval O
, O
stressed O
the O
role O
of O
repentance O
in O
the O
forgiveness O
of O
sins O
, O
despite O
Luther O
's O
position O
that O
faith O
alone O
ensures O
justification O
. O

The O
Eisleben O
reformer O
Johannes O
Agricola O
challenged O
this O
compromise O
, O
and O
Luther O
condemned O
him O
for O
teaching O
that O
faith O
is O
separate O
from O
works O
. O

The O
Instruction O
is O
a O
problematic O
document O
for O
those O
seeking O
a O
consistent O
evolution O
in O
Luther O
's O
thought O
and O
practice O
. O

In O
response O
to O
demands O
for O
a O
German O
liturgy O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
a O
German O
Mass O
, O
which O
he O
published O
in O
early B-KP
1526 B-KP
. O

He O
did O
not O
intend O
it O
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
his O
1523 B-KP
adaptation B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Latin I-KP
Mass I-KP
but O
as O
an O
alternative O
for O
the O
`` O
simple B-KP
people I-KP
'' O
, O
a O
`` O
public O
stimulation O
for O
people O
to O
believe O
and O
become O
Christians O
. O
'' O

Luther O
based O
his O
order O
on O
the O
Catholic O
service O
but O
omitted O
`` O
everything B-KP
that I-KP
smacks I-KP
of I-KP
sacrifice I-KP
'' O
; O
and O
the O
Mass O
became O
a O
celebration O
where O
everyone O
received O
the O
wine B-KP
as I-KP
well I-KP
as I-KP
the I-KP
bread I-KP
. O

He O
retained O
the O
elevation O
of O
the O
host O
and O
chalice O
, O
while O
trappings O
such O
as O
the O
Mass O
vestments O
, O
altar O
, O
and O
candles O
were O
made O
optional O
, O
allowing O
freedom B-KP
of I-KP
ceremony I-KP
. O

Some O
reformers O
, O
including O
followers O
of O
Huldrych O
Zwingli O
, O
considered O
Luther O
's O
service O
too O
papistic O
; O
and O
modern O
scholars O
note O
the O
conservatism O
of O
his O
alternative O
to O
the O
Catholic O
mass O
. O

Luther O
's O
service O
, O
however O
, O
included O
congregational O
singing O
of O
hymns O
and O
psalms O
in O
German O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
parts O
of O
the O
liturgy O
, O
including O
Luther O
's O
unison O
setting O
of O
the O
Creed O
. O

To O
reach O
the O
simple O
people O
and O
the O
young O
, O
Luther O
incorporated O
religious O
instruction O
into O
the O
weekday O
services O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
catechism O
. O

He O
also O
provided O
simplified O
versions O
of O
the O
baptism O
and O
marriage O
services O
. O

Luther O
and O
his O
colleagues O
introduced O
the O
new O
order O
of O
worship O
during O
their O
visitation B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Electorate I-KP
of I-KP
Saxony I-KP
, I-KP
which O
began O
in O
1527 B-KP
. O

They O
also O
assessed O
the O
standard B-KP
of I-KP
pastoral I-KP
care I-KP
and I-KP
Christian I-KP
education I-KP
in O
the O
territory O
. O

`` O
Merciful O
God O
, O
what O
misery O
I O
have O
seen O
, O
'' O
Luther O
wrote O
, O
`` O
the O
common O
people O
knowing O
nothing O
at O
all O
of O
Christian B-KP
doctrine I-KP
... O
and O
unfortunately O
many O
pastors O
are O
well O
nigh O
unskilled O
and O
incapable B-KP
of I-KP
teaching B-KP
. O
'' O

Luther O
devised O
the O
catechism B-KP
as O
a O
method O
of O
imparting O
the O
basics O
of O
Christianity O
to O
the O
congregations O
. O

In O
1529 B-KP
, O
he O
wrote O
the O
Large O
Catechism O
, O
a O
manual O
for O
pastors B-KP
and I-KP
teachers I-KP
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
synopsis O
, O
the O
Small O
Catechism O
, O
to O
be O
memorised O
by O
the B-KP
people B-KP
themselves O
. O

The O
catechisms O
provided O
easy O
to O
understand O
instructional O
and O
devotional O
material O
on O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
, O
the O
Apostles O
' O
Creed O
, O
the O
Lord O
's O
Prayer O
, O
baptism O
, O
and O
the O
Lord O
's O
Supper O
. O

Luther O
incorporated O
questions B-KP
and I-KP
answers I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
catechism I-KP
so I-KP
that I-KP
the I-KP
basics I-KP
of I-KP
Christian I-KP
faith I-KP
would O
not O
just O
be O
learned O
by O
rote O
, O
`` O
the O
way O
monkeys O
do O
it O
'' O
, O
but O
understood O
. O

The B-KP
catechism B-KP
is O
one O
of O
Luther O
's O
most O
personal O
works O
. O

`` O
Regarding O
the O
plan B-KP
to I-KP
collect I-KP
my I-KP
writings I-KP
in I-KP
volumes I-KP
, O
'' O
he O
wrote O
, O
`` O
I O
am O
quite O
cool O
and O
not O
at O
all O
eager O
about O
it O
because O
, O
roused O

Saturnian B-KP

'' O

The B-KP
Small I-KP
Catechism I-KP
has O
earned O
a O
reputation O
as O
a O
model O
of O
clear O
religious O
teaching O
. O

It O
remains O
in O
use O
today O
, O
along O
with O
Luther O
's O
hymns O
and O
his O
translation O
of O
the B-KP
Bible B-KP

Luther O
's O
Small B-KP
Catechism I-KP
proved O
especially O
effective O
in O
helping O
parents O
teach O
their O
children O
; O
likewise O
the O
Larger B-KP
Catechism I-KP
was O
effective O
for O
pastors O
. O

Using O
the O
German B-KP
vernacular I-KP
, O
they O
expressed O
the O
Apostles O
' O
Creed O
in O
simpler O
, O
more O
personal O
, O
Trinitarian O
language O
. O

He O
rewrote O
each O
article O
of O
the O
Creed O
to O
express O
the O
character O
of O
the O
Father B-KP

the I-KP
Son I-KP
, I-KP
or I-KP
the I-KP
Holy I-KP

Luther O
's O
goal O
was O
to O
enable O
the O
catechumens O
to O
see O
themselves O
as O
a O
personal O
object O
of O
the O
work O

the O
three O
persons O
of O
the O

each O
of O

the O
catechumen O

life O

That O
is O
, O
Luther O
depicted O
the O
Trinity O
not O
as O
a O
doctrine O
to O
be O
learned O

as B-KP
persons B-KP

a O
divine O
unity O

. O

Salvation O
originates O
with B-KP
the I-KP
Father B-KP

draws O
the O
believer O
to O
the O
Father O
. O

Luther O
's O
treatment O
of O
the O
Apostles O
' O
Creed O
must O
be O
understood O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
Decalogue O
( O
the O
Ten O

and O
the O
Lord O

Prayer O
, O
which O
are O
also O
part O
of O
the O
Lutheran O
catechical O
teaching O

Luther O
had O
published O
his O
German O
translation O
of O
the O
New O
Testament O
in O
1522 B-KP
, O
and O
he O
and O
his O
collaborators O
completed O
the O
translation O
of O
the O
Old O
Testament O
in O
1534 B-KP
, O
when O
the O
whole O

the B-KP

life O

his O
translation O

the O
word O
`` O

Sixteenth O
century O
Lutheran O
hymnals O
also O

the O
catechetical O
hymns O
, O
although O
18th O
century O
hymnals O
tended O
to O
label O
the O
hymn O
as O
Trinitarian O
rather O
than O
catechetical O
, O
and O
20th O

Lutherans O
rarely O
use O

the O

The O

functioned O
both O
as O
a O

Luther O
developed O
his O
original O
four O

this O

In O
contrast O
to O
the O
views O
of O
John O
Calvin O

Philipp O
Melanchthon O
, O
throughout O
his O
life O
Luther O
maintained O
that O
it O

not O
false O
doctrine O

sleeps B-KP
after O
it O
is O
separated O
from O
the O
body O
in O
death O
; O
and O
, O
accordingly O
, O
he O
disputed O
traditional O
interpretations O
of O
some O
Bible B-KP
passages O
, O
such O
as O
the O
parable O
of O
the O
rich O
man O
and O
Lazarus O
. O

This O
also O
led O
Luther O
to O
reject O
the O
idea B-KP
of I-KP
torments B-KP
for O
the O
saints O
: O
`` O
It O
is O

'' O

He O
also O
rejected B-KP
the I-KP
existence I-KP
of I-KP
Purgatory O
, O
which O
involved O
Christian O
souls O
undergoing O
penitential O
suffering O
after O

He O
affirmed O
the O
continuity O
of O
one O

personal O
identity O
beyond O
death O
. O

In O
his O
Smalcald B-KP
Articles I-KP

he O
described O
the O

`` O

The O
Lutheran O
theologian O
Franz B-KP

observed O
that O
Luther O

teaching O
about O
the O
state O
of O
the O
Christian O

after O

differed O
from O
the O
later O
Lutheran O
theologians O
such O
as O
Johann B-KP
Gerhard B-KP
. I-KP
Lessing B-KP
( O
1755 B-KP

had O
earlier O
reached O
the O
same O
conclusion O
in O
his O
analysis O
of O
Lutheran O
orthodoxy O
on O
this O
issue O
. O

Luther O
's O
Commentary B-KP
on I-KP
Genesis I-KP
contains O
a O
passage O
which O
concludes O
that O
`` O
the O

not O

, O

Francis B-KP
Blackburne B-KP
in O
1765 B-KP
argued O
that O
John O
Jortin O
misread O
this O
and O
other O
passages O
from O
Luther O
, O
while O
Gottfried B-KP
Fritschel B-KP
pointed O
out O
in O
1867 O
that O
it O
actually O

the O

Despite O
the O
disagreements O
on O
the O

the O

paved O
the O
way O
for O
the O
signing O
in O
1530 B-KP
of O
the O
Augsburg O
Confession O
, O
and O
for O
the O
formation O
of O

The B-KP
Swiss I-KP
cities I-KP
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
sign O
these O
agreements O
. O

Some O
scholars O
have O
asserted O
that O
Luther O
taught O
that O
faith O
and O
reason O
were O
antithetical B-KP
in O
the O
sense O
that O
questions O
of O
faith O
could O
not O
be O
illuminated O
by O
reason B-KP
. O

He O
wrote O
, O
`` O
All O
the O
articles O
of O
our O
Christian O
faith O
, O
which O
God O
has O
revealed O
to O
us O
in O
His O
Word O
, O
are O
in O
presence O
of O
reason O
sheerly O
impossible O
, O
absurd O
, O
and O
false O
. O
'' O

and O
`` O
[ O
That O
] O
Reason B-KP
in B-KP
no I-KP
way I-KP
contributes I-KP

. O

[ O
... O
] O
For O
reason B-KP
is O
the O
greatest O
enemy O
that O
faith O
has O
; O
it O
never O
comes O
to O
the O
aid O
of O
spiritual O
things O
. O
'' O

However O
, O
though O
seemingly O
contradictorily O
, O
he O
also O
wrote O
in O
the O
latter O
work O
that O
human B-KP
reason I-KP
`` O
strives O
not O
against O
faith O
, O
when O
enlightened O
, O
but O
rather O
furthers O
and O
advances O
it O
'' O
, O
bringing O
claims O
he O
was O
a O
fideist O
into O
dispute O
. O

Contemporary O
Lutheran O
scholarship O
, O
however O
, O
has O
found O
a O
different O
reality O
in O
Luther O
. O

Luther O
rather O
seeks O
to O
separate O
faith O
and O
reason O
in O
order O
to O
honor O
the O
separate B-KP
spheres I-KP
of I-KP
knowledge I-KP
that I-KP
each I-KP
applies I-KP
to I-KP
. O

Bernhard O
Lohse O
, O
for O
example O
, O
has O
demonstrated O
in O
his O
classic O
work O
`` O
Fides O
und O
Ratio O
'' O
that O
Luther O
ultimately O
sought O
to O
put O
the O
two O
together O
. O

More O
recently O
, O
Hans O
Peter O
Grosshans O
has O
demonstrated O
that O
Luther O
's O
work O
on O
Biblical O
Criticism O
stresses O
the O
need O
for O
external O
coherence O
in O
the O
right O
exegetical O
method O
. O

This O
means O
that O
for O
Luther O
it O
is O
more O
important O
that O
the O
Bible O
is O
reasonable O
according O
to O
the O
reality O
outside O
of O
the O
scriptures O
than O
that O
the O
Bible O
makes O
sense O
to O
itself O
, O
that O
it O
has O
internal O
coherence O
. O

The O
right O
tool O
for O
understanding O
the O
world O
outside O
of O
the O
Bible O
for O
Luther O
is O
none O
other O
than O
reason O
, O
which O
for O
him O
is O
the O
field O
of O
science O
, O
philosophy O
, O
history O
and O
empirical O
observation O
. O

Here O
a O
different O
picture O
is O
presented O
of O
a O
Luther O
who O
deeply O
valued O
both O
faith O
and O
reason O
, O
and O
held O
them O
in O
dialectical O
partnership O
. O

Luther O
's O
concern O
thus O
in O
separating O
them O
is O
honoring O
their O
different B-KP
epistemological I-KP
spheres I-KP
. I-KP

In O
1523 O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
that B-KP
Jesus I-KP
Christ I-KP
was I-KP
born I-KP
a I-KP
Jew I-KP
which O
discouraged O
mistreatment O
of O
the O
Jews O
and O
advocated O
their O
conversion B-KP
by O
proving O
that O
the O
Old O
Testament O
could O
be O
shown O
to O
speak O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
Reformation O
continued O
, O
Luther O
began O
to O
lose O
hope O
in O
large B-KP
scale I-KP
Jewish I-KP
conversion I-KP
to I-KP
Christianity I-KP
. O

In O
his O
later O
years O
, O
Luther O
grew O
more O
hostile O
toward O
the O
Jews B-KP
, O
writing O
against O
them O
with O
the O
kind O
of O
venom O
he O
had O
already O
unleashed O
on O
the O
Anabaptists B-KP
, I-KP
Zwinglianism I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
papacy I-KP
. O

His O
1543 B-KP
treatise O
Von O
den O
Juden O
und O
ihren O
L O
gen O
( O
On O
the O
Jews O
and O
Their O
Lies O
) O
took O
its O
place O
among O
other O
anti O
Jewish O
literature O
of O
the O
times O
, O
although O
historians O
acknowledge O
that O
this O
treatise O
was O
particularly O
extreme O
, O
even O
by O
the O
standards O
of O
sixteenth O
century O
Europe O
. O

In O
it O
, O
he O
takes O
a O
hardline O
against O
Judaism O
, O
writing O
that O
synagogues O
and O
Jewish O
homes O
should O
be O
destroyed O
, O
their O
money O
confiscated O
, O
and O
liberty O
curtailed O
. O

These O
statements O
and O
their O
influence O
on O
antisemitism O
have O
contributed O
to O
his O
controversial O
status O
. O

At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Marburg O
Colloquy O
, O
Suleiman O
the O
Magnificent O
was O
besieging O
Vienna O
with O
a O
vast O
Ottoman O
army O
. O

Luther O
had O
argued B-KP
against I-KP
resisting I-KP
the O
Turks O
in O
his O
1518 O
Explanation O
of O
the O
Ninety O
five O
Theses O
, O
provoking O
accusations O
of O
defeatism O
. O

He O
saw O
the O
Turks O
as B-KP
a I-KP
scourge B-KP
sent I-KP
to I-KP
punish B-KP
Christians I-KP
by I-KP
God I-KP
, O
as O
agents O
of O
the O
Biblical O
apocalypse O
that O
would O
destroy B-KP
the I-KP
antichrist I-KP
, O
whom O
Luther O
believed O
to O
be O
the B-KP
papacy B-KP
, O
and O
the O
Roman O
Church O
. O

He O
consistently O
rejected O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
Holy O
War O
, O
`` O
as O
though O
our O
people O
were O
an O
army O
of O
Christians O
against O
the O
Turks O
, O
who O
were O
enemies O
of O
Christ O
. O

This O
is O
absolutely O
contrary O
to O
Christ O
's O
doctrine O
and O
name O
'' O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
in O
keeping O
with O
his O
doctrine O
of O
the O
two O
kingdoms O
, O
Luther O
did O
support O
non B-KP
religious I-KP
war I-KP
against O
the O
Turks O
. O

In O
1526 O
, O
he O
argued O
in O
Whether O
Soldiers O
can O
be O
in O
a O
State O
of O
Grace O
that O
national O
defence O
is O
reason O
for O
a O
just O
war O
. O

By O
1529 O
, O
in O
On O
War O
against O
the O
Turk O
, O
he O
was O
actively O
urging O
Emperor O
Charles O
V O
and O
the O
German O
people O
to O
fight O
a O
secular B-KP
war I-KP
against O
the O
Turks O
. O

He O
made O
clear O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
spiritual O
war O
against O
an O
alien O
faith O
was O
separate O
, O
to O
be O
waged O
through O
prayer O
and O
repentance O
. O

Around O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Siege O
of O
Vienna O
, O
Luther O
wrote O
a O
prayer O
for O
national O
deliverance O
from O
the O
Turks O
, O
asking O
God O
to O
`` O
give O
to O
our O
emperor O
perpetual O
victory O
over O
our O
enemies O
'' O
. O

In O
1542 O
, O
Luther O
read O
a O
Latin O
translation O
of O
the O
Qur'an B-KP
. O

He O
went O
on O
to O
produce O
several O
critical B-KP
pamphlets B-KP
on I-KP
Islam B-KP
, O
which O
he O
called O
`` O
Mohammedanism O
'' O
or O
`` O
the O
Turk O
'' O
. O

Though O
Luther O
saw O
the O
Muslim O
faith O
as O
a B-KP
tool B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
devil I-KP
, I-KP
he O
was O
indifferent O
to O
its O
practice O
: O
`` O
Let O
the O
Turk O
believe O
and O
live O
as O
he O
will O
, O
just O
as O
one O
lets O
the O
papacy O
and O
other O
false O
Christians O
live O
. O
'' O

He O
opposed O
banning O
the O
publication O
of O
the O
Qur'an O
, O
wanting B-KP
it I-KP
exposed B-KP
to I-KP
scrutiny I-KP
. I-KP

Early O
in O
1537 O
, O
Johannes B-KP
Agricola I-KP
( O
1494 O
1566 O
) O
serving O
at O
the O
time O
as O
pastor O
in O
Luther O
's O
birthplace O
, O
Eisleben O
preached O
a O
sermon O
in O
which O
he O
claimed O
that O
God O
's O
gospel O
, O
not O
God O
's O
moral O
law O
( O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
) O
, O
revealed O
God B-KP
's I-KP
wrath I-KP
to I-KP
Christians I-KP
. I-KP

Based O
on O
this O
sermon O
and O
others O
by O
Agricola O
, O
Luther O
suspected O
that O
Agricola B-KP
was O
behind O
certain O
anonymous O
antinomian O
theses O
circulating O
in O
Wittenberg O
. O

These O
theses O
asserted O
that O
the O
law O
is O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
taught O
to O
Christians O
but O
belonged O
only O
to O
city B-KP
hall I-KP
. I-KP

Luther O
responded O
to O
these O
theses O
with O
six B-KP
series I-KP
of I-KP
theses I-KP
against I-KP
Agricola I-KP
and O
the O
antinomians O
, O
four O
of O
which O
became O
the O
basis O
for O
disputations O
between O
1538 O
and O
1540 O
. O

He O
also O
responded O
to O
these O
assertions O
in O
other O
writings O
, O
such O
as O
his O
1539 O
open O
letter O
to O
C. O
G O
ttel O
Against O
the O
Antinomians O
, O
and O
his O
book O
On B-KP
the I-KP
Councils I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
Church I-KP
from O
the O
same O
year O
. O

In O
his O
theses O
and O
disputations O
against O
the O
antinomians O
, O
Luther O
reviews O
and O
reaffirms O
, O
on O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
what O
has O
been O
called O
the O
`` O
second B-KP
use I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
law I-KP

'' O
that O

thus O
preparing O
him O
for O

of O
the O

in O
the O

Luther O
states O
that O
everything B-KP
that I-KP
is I-KP
used I-KP
to I-KP
work I-KP
sorrow I-KP
over I-KP
sin I-KP

called I-KP

, O
Christ O
's O
death O

or O
God O

Simply O
refusing O
to O
preach O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
among O
Christians O
thereby O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
removing O
the O
three O
letters O
l O
a O
w O
from O
the O
church O
does O
not O
eliminate B-KP
the I-KP
accusing I-KP
law I-KP
. I-KP

Claiming O
that O
the O
law O
in O
any O
form O
should O
not O
be O
preached O
to O
Christians O
anymore O
would O
be O
tantamount O
to O
asserting O
that O
Christians O
are O
no O
longer O
sinners O
in O
themselves O
and O
that O
the O
church O
consists O
only B-KP
of I-KP
essentially I-KP
holy I-KP
people I-KP
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Luther O
also O
points O
out O
that O
the B-KP
Ten B-KP
Commandments I-KP
when O
considered O
not O
as O
God O
's O
condemning O
judgment O
but O
as O
an O
expression O
of O
his O
eternal O
will O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
the O
natural O
law O
also O
positively O
teach O
how B-KP
the I-KP
Christian I-KP
ought I-KP

This O
has O
traditionally O
been O
called O
the O
`` O
third B-KP

'' O

For O
Luther O
, O
also O
Christ O

life O
, O
when O
understood O
as O
an O
example O
, O
is O
nothing O
more O
than O
an B-KP
illustration B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP

a O

Luther O
's O
teaching O
of O
the O
Ten O
Commandments O
, O
therefore O
, O
has O
clear O
eschatological O
overtones O
, O
which O
, O
characteristically O
for O
Luther O
, O
do O
not O
encourage O

From O
December O

the O
bigamy B-KP

Philip O

Landgrave O

Philip O
solicited O
the O
approval O

Melanchthon O

and O
Bucer O
, O
citing O
as O
a O
precedent O
the O

The O

were O
not O
prepared O

they O
reluctantly O
advised O

However O
, O
Philip O
was O
unable O
to O
keep O
the O
marriage O
secret O
, O
and O
he O
threatened O
to O
make O
Luther O

advice O
public O
. O

Luther O
told O
him O
to O
`` O
tell O
a O

strong O

'' O
and O
deny O
the O
marriage O
completely O

which O

In O
the O
view O
of O
Luther O
's O
biographer O
Martin O
Brecht O
, O
`` O
giving O
confessional O
advice O
for O
Philip O
of O
Hesse O
was O
one B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
worst I-KP
mistakes I-KP
Luther I-KP
made I-KP
, I-KP

, O
next O
to O
the O
landgrave O
himself O
, O
who O
was O
directly O
responsible O
for O
it O
, O
history O
chiefly O
holds B-KP
Luther B-KP
accountable I-KP
'' O
. O

Brecht O
argues O
that O
Luther O
's O
mistake O
was O
not O
that O
he O
gave O
private O
pastoral O
advice O
, O
but O
that O
he O
miscalculated O
the O
political O
implications O
. O

The O
affair O
caused B-KP
lasting I-KP
damage I-KP
to O
Luther O
's O
reputation O
. O

Luther O
wrote O
about O
the O
Jews O
throughout O
his O
career O
, O
though O
only O
a O
few O
of O
his O
works O
dealt O
with O
them O
directly O
. O

Luther O
rarely O
encountered O
Jews B-KP
during O
his O
life O
, O
but O
his O
attitudes O
reflected O
a O
theological O
and O
cultural O
tradition O
which O
saw O
Jews B-KP
as O
a O
rejected O
people O
guilty O
of O
the O
murder B-KP
of I-KP
Christ I-KP
, I-KP
and O
he O
lived O
within O
a O
local O
community O
that O
had O
expelled B-KP
Jews I-KP
some O
ninety O
years O
earlier O
. O

He O
considered O
the O
Jews O
blasphemers O
and O
liars O
because O
they O
rejected O
the O
divinity B-KP
of I-KP
Jesus I-KP
, O
whereas O
Christians O
believed O
Jesus O
was O
the O
Messiah O
. O

But O
Luther O
believed O
that O
all O
human O
beings O
who O
set O
themselves O
against O
God O
were O
equally O
guilty O
. O

As O
early O
as O
1516 O
, O
he O
wrote O
that O
many O
people O
`` O
are O
proud O
with O
marvelous O
stupidity O
when O
they O
call O
the O
Jews O
dogs O
, O
evildoers O
, O
or O
whatever O
they O
like O
, O
while O
they O
too O
, O
and O
equally O
, O
do O
not O
realize O
who O
or O
what O
they O
are O
in O
the O
sight O
of O
God O
'' O
. O

In O
1523 O
, O
Luther O
advised O
kindness O
toward O
the O
Jews O
in O
That O
Jesus O
Christ O
was O
Born O
a O
Jew O
and O
also O
aimed O
to O
convert B-KP
them I-KP
to I-KP
Christianity I-KP
. I-KP

When O
his O
efforts O
at O
conversion O
failed O
, O
he O
grew O
increasingly O
bitter O
toward O
them O
. O

In O

Bonhoeffer O

`` O

Luther O
called O
for O
a O
`` O

against O
the O

'' O

Luther O
advocated O
setting O
synagogues O

fire O
, O
destroying O

prayerbooks O
, O
forbidding O
rabbis O
from O

In O
Robert O
Michael O

view O
, O
Luther O
's O
words O
`` O
We O
are O
at O
fault O
in O

amounted O
to O
a B-KP
sanction I-KP

`` O
God O

'' O
Luther O
concluded O
, O
`` O

urge O
his O

Luther O

influence O
persisted O
after O
his O
death O

Throughout B-KP
the B-KP
1580s B-KP
, O
riots O
led O
to O
the O
expulsion O

Luther B-KP
was O
the O
most O
widely O
read O
author O
of O
his O
generation O

within O

acquired O
the O

According O
to O
the O
prevailing O
view O
among O
historians O

his O
anti B-KP
Jewish I-KP

contributed O
significantly O
to O

development O
of O
antisemitism B-KP

Germany O
, O

in O
the O
1930s O

At O
the O
heart O
of O
scholars O
' O
debate O
about O
Luther O

influence O
is O
whether O
it O
is O
anachronistic O
to O
view O
his O
work O
as O
a O
precursor O
of O
the O
racial O
antisemitism O

Some O
scholars O
see O
Luther O

influence O
as O
limited B-KP
, O
and O
the O
Nazis O
' O
use O
of O
his O
work O
as O
opportunistic B-KP

Biographer O
Martin O
Brecht O
points O
out O
that O
`` O
There O
is O
a O
world O
of O
difference O
between O
his O
belief O

Nevertheless O
, O
his O
misguided B-KP
agitation I-KP
had O
the O
evil O
result O
that O
Luther O
fatefully O
became O
one O
of O
the O
'church O
fathers O
' O
of O
anti O
Semitism O
and O
thus O
provided O
material O
for O
the O
modern B-KP
hatred B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Jews I-KP
, O
cloaking O
it O
with O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
Reformer O

'' O

Johannes O
Wallmann O
argues O
that O
Luther O
's O
writings O
against O
the O
Jews O
were O
largely O
ignored O
in O
the O
18th B-KP
and I-KP
19th I-KP
centuries I-KP
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
continuity O
between O
Luther O
's O
thought O
and O
Nazi O
ideology O
. O

Uwe O
Siemon O
Netto O
agreed O
, O
arguing O
that O
it O
was O
because O
the O
Nazis O
were O
already O
anti O
Semites O
that O
they O
revived O
Luther O
's O
work O
. O

Hans O
J. O
Hillerbrand O
agreed O
that O
to O
focus O
on O
Luther O
was O
to O
adopt O
an O
essentially O
ahistorical O
perspective O
of O
Nazi O
antisemitism O
that O
ignored O

factors O

German O
history O

Similarly O
, O
Roland O
Bainton O
, O
noted O
church O
historian O

wrote O
`` O

its O

Point O

the B-KP
Tehachapi I-KP

Though O
there O
is O
no O
official O
definition O
for O
the O
northern O
boundary O
of O
southern O
California O
, O
such O
a O
division O
has O
existed O
from O
the O
time O
when O
Mexico B-KP
ruled O
California O
, O
and O
political O
disputes O
raged O
between O
the O
Californios O

in O
the O

Los O

California I-KP
. O

Following O
the O
acquisition O
of O
California O
by O
the O
United O

, O
the O
division O
continued O
as O
part O
of O
the O
attempt O
by O
several O
pro O

politicians O
to O
arrange O
the O
division O
of O

at O
36 O

30 O

Compromise I-KP
. O

Instead O
, O
the O
passing O
of O
the B-KP
Compromise B-KP
of I-KP
1850 I-KP
enabled O
California O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
Union O
as O
a B-KP
free B-KP
state I-KP
, O
preventing O
southern O
California O
from O
becoming O
its O
own O
separate O
slave O
state O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
Californios O
( O
dissatisfied O
with O
inequitable B-KP
taxes I-KP
and O
land O
laws O
) O
and O
pro O
slavery O
southerners O
in O
the O
lightly O
populated O
`` O
Cow B-KP
Counties I-KP
'' O
of O
southern O
California O
attempted O
three B-KP
times O
in O
the O
1850s O
to O
achieve O
a O
separate O
statehood O
or O
territorial O
status O
separate O
from O
Northern O
California O
. O

The O
last O
attempt O
, O
the O
Pico O
Act O
of O
1859 O
, O
was O
passed O
by O
the O
California O
State O
Legislature O
and O
signed O
by O
the O
State O
governor O
John O
B. O
Weller O
. O

It O
was O
approved O
overwhelmingly O
by O
nearly O
75 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
voters O
in O
the O
proposed O
Territory O
of O
Colorado O
. O

This O
territory O
was O
to O
include O
all O
the O
counties O
up O
to O
the O
then O
much O
larger O
Tulare O
County O
( O
that O
included O

) O
and O
San O

The O
proposal O
was O
sent O
to O
Washington O
, O
D.C. O
with O
a O
strong O
advocate O
in O
Senator O
Milton B-KP
Latham I-KP
. O

However O
, O
the O
secession O
crisis O
following O
the O
election O
of O
Abraham O
Lincoln O
in O
1860 O
led O
to O
the O
proposal O
never O
coming O
to O
a O
vote O
. O

In O
1900 B-KP
, O
the B-KP
Los B-KP
Angeles I-KP
Times I-KP
defined O
southern O

In O

the O

added O

In O

the O

fought O
hard O

ITV O

BSkyB O
joined O

make O
a O

The B-KP
BBC B-KP
was O
given O

BSkyB O
paying O

A O

, O
ITV O
went O

it O
believed O

the O

ITV O
also O
asked O
the O
Office O

since O
it O
believed O
Rupert O
Murdoch O

A O
few O
days O

neither O

ITV O
believed O
BSkyB O

Premier O

At O
this O

the O
religiously O
conflicted O

using O

the O

Hugues O
by O
way O
of O
the O
Dutch O
word O
Huisgenoten O
( O
literally O
housemates O
) O
, O
referring O
to O
the O
connotations O
of O
a O
somewhat O
related O
word O
in O
German O
Eidgenosse O
( O
Confederates O

In O
Geneva O
, O
Hugues O
, O
though O
Catholic O
, O
was O
a O
leader O
of O
the O
`` O
Confederate O
Party O
'' O
, O
so O
called O
because O
it O
favoured O
independence O
from O
the O

through O
an O
alliance O
between O
the O
city O
state O
of O
Geneva O
and O
the O
Swiss O
Confederation O
. O

The O
label O
Huguenot O
was O
purportedly O
first O
applied O
in O
France O
to O
those O
conspirators O
( O
all O
of O
them O

involved O
in O
the B-KP

foiled O
attempt O

wrest O
power O

The O
move O

side O

Thus O
, O
Hugues O
plus O
Eidgenosse O
by O

supposedly O
became O

what O

in O
that O
it O
could O

was O
the B-KP
atmospheric I-KP
engine I-KP
, O
invented O
by O
Thomas B-KP
Newcomen I-KP
around B-KP
1712 B-KP
. O

It O
was O
an O
improvement O
over O
Savery O

steam B-KP
pump I-KP
, O
using O
a O
piston O
as O
proposed O
by O
Papin B-KP

Newcomen O
's O
engine O
was O
relatively O
inefficient O
, O
and O
in O
most O
cases O
was O
used O
for O
pumping O
water O

It O
worked O
by O
creating O
a O
partial O
vacuum O
by O
condensing O
steam O
under O
a O

a O
cylinder O

It O
was O
employed O
for O

also O
for O

The O
first O

was O
built O
by O
Richard O
Trevithick O
in O
the O
United B-KP

, O
on O
21 B-KP
February I-KP
1804 I-KP
, O
the O

took O

Trevithick O

hauled O
a O
train O
along O
the O

from O
the O
Pen O

, O
near O
Merthyr O
Tydfil O
to O
Abercynon B-KP
in I-KP
south B-KP
Wales B-KP
. O

The O
design O
incorporated O
a O
number O
of O
important O
innovations O
that O
included O
using O
high O
pressure O
steam O
which O
reduced O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
engine O
and O
increased O
its O
efficiency O
. O

Trevithick O
visited O
the O
Newcastle O
area O
later O
in O
1804 O
and O
the O
colliery O
railways O
in O
north O
east O
England O
became O
the O
leading O
centre O
for O
experimentation O
and O
development O
of O
steam O
locomotives O
. O

The O
Rankine O
cycle O
and O
most O
practical O
steam O
engines O
have O
a O
water B-KP
pump I-KP
to O
recycle O
or O
top O
up O
the O
boiler O
water O
, O
so O
that O
they O
may O
be O
run O
continuously O
. O

Utility O
and O
industrial O
boilers O
commonly O
use O
multi B-KP
stage I-KP
centrifugal I-KP
pumps I-KP
; O
however O
, O
other O
types O
are O
used O
. O

Another O
means O
of O
supplying O
lower B-KP
pressure I-KP
boiler I-KP
feed I-KP
water I-KP
is O
an O
injector O
, O
which O
uses O
a O
steam O
jet O
usually O
supplied O
from O
the O
boiler O
. O

Injectors O
became O
popular O
in O
the O
1850s B-KP
but O
are O
no O
longer O
widely O
used O
, O
except O
in O
applications O
such O
as O
steam B-KP
locomotives I-KP
. O

It O
is O
a O
logical O
extension O
of O
the O
compound O
engine O
( O
described O
above O
) O
to O
split O
the O
expansion O
into O
yet O
more O
stages O
to O
increase O
efficiency O
. O

The O
result O
is O
the O
multiple O
expansion O
engine O
. O

Such O
engines O
use O
either O
three B-KP
or I-KP
four I-KP
expansion O
stages O
and O
are O
known O
as O
triple O
and O
quadruple B-KP
expansion I-KP
engines I-KP
respectively O
. O

These O
engines O
use O
a O
series O
of O
cylinders O
of O
progressively O
increasing O
diameter O
. O

These O
cylinders O
are O
designed O
to O
divide O
the O
work O
into O
equal O
shares O
for O
each O
expansion O
stage O
. O

As O
with O
the O
double O
expansion O
engine O
, O
if O
space O
is O
at O
a O
premium O
, O
then O
two O
smaller O
cylinders O
may O
be O
used O
for O
the O
low O
pressure O
stage O
. O

Multiple O
expansion O
engines O
typically O
had O
the O
cylinders O
arranged O
inline O
, O
but O
various O
other O
formations O
were O
used O
. O

In O
the O
late O
19th B-KP
century O
, O
the O
Yarrow O
Schlick O
Tweedy O
balancing O
'system O
' O
was O
used O
on O
some O
marine B-KP
triple I-KP
expansion I-KP
engines I-KP
. O

Y O
S O
T O
engines O
divided O
the O
low O
pressure O
expansion O
stages O
between O
two O
cylinders O
, O
one O
at O
each O
end O
of O
the O
engine O
. O

This O
allowed O
the O
crankshaft O
to O
be O
better O
balanced O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
smoother O
, O
faster O
responding O
engine O
which O
ran O
with O
less O
vibration O
. O

This O
made O
the O
4 O
cylinder O
triple O
expansion O
engine O
popular O
with O
large O
passenger O
liners O
( O
such O
as O
the O
Olympic B-KP
class I-KP
) O
, O
but O
this O
was O
ultimately O
replaced O
by O
the O
virtually O
vibration O
free O
turbine O
engine O
. O

In O
the O
1840s O
and O
50s O
, O
there O
were O
attempts O
to O
overcome O
this O
problem O
by O
means O
of O
various O
patent B-KP
valve I-KP

with O
a O
separate O

cutoff O
expansion O
valve O
riding O

the O
back O
of O
the O
main O
slide O
valve O
; O
the O
latter O
usually O
had O
fixed O
or O
limited O
cutoff O
. O

The O
combined O
setup O
gave O
a O
fair O
approximation O
of O
the O
ideal O
events O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
increased O
friction O
and O
wear O
, O
and O
the O
mechanism O
tended O
to O
be O
complicated O
. O

The O
usual O
compromise O
solution O
has O
been O
to O
provide O
lap O
by O
lengthening B-KP
rubbing I-KP
surfaces I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
valve I-KP
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
to O
overlap O
the O
port O
on O
the O
admission O
side O
, O
with O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
exhaust O
side O
remains O
open O
for O
a O
longer O
period O
after O
cut O
off O
on O
the O
admission O
side O
has O
occurred O
. O

This O
expedient O
has O
since O
been O
generally O
considered O
satisfactory O
for O
most O
purposes O

makes O
possible O
the O
use O

did O
some O
useful O
work O
on O
the O
steam O

in O
1679 O
, O
and O
first O
used O
a O

Near O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
compound B-KP
engines I-KP
came O
into O
widespread O
use O
. O

Compound O
engines O
exhausted O
steam O
in O
to O
successively O
larger O
cylinders O
to O
accommodate O
the O
higher O
volumes O
at O
reduced O
pressures O
, O
giving O
improved O
efficiency O

These O
stages O
were O
called O
expansions B-KP

with O
double O
and O
triple O
expansion O
engines O
being O
common O
, O
especially O
in O
shipping B-KP
where O
efficiency O
was O
important O
to O
reduce O
the O
weight O
of O

carried O
. O

Steam O
engines O
remained O
the O
dominant O
source O
of O
power O
until O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
, O
when O
advances O
in O
the O
design O
of O
electric O

gradually O
resulted O
in O
the O
replacement O

steam O
engines O
, O
with O

the O
20th O

The O
final O
major O
evolution O
of O

design O
was O
the O
use O
of O
steam B-KP

starting O
in O
the O
late B-KP

of O
the O
19th O

are O
generally O
more O

( O
for O

Steam O
turbines O
virtually O
replaced O

engines O
in O

early O
in O
the O
20th O

where O
their O
efficiency O

were O
advantages O
. O

Today O
most O
electric B-KP

is O
provided O
by O
steam O

In O
the O
United O

of O
the O
electric B-KP

in O
this O
way O

Steam O
turbines O
were O
extensively O

The O
heat O
required O
for O
boiling O
the O
water O
and O
supplying O
the O
steam O
can O
be O
derived O
from O
various O

A O
method O
to O

British B-KP

Arthur B-KP
Woolf I-KP
, O
who O
patented O
his O
Woolf O
high O

engine O
in O
1805 O
. O

In O
the O
compound O
engine O
, O
high O
pressure O
steam O
from O
the O
boiler O
expands O
in O
a O
high O
pressure O
( O
HP O
) O
cylinder O
and O
then O
enters O
one O
or O
more O
subsequent O
lower O
pressure O
( O
LP O
) O
cylinders O
. O

The O
complete O
expansion O
of O
the O
steam O
now O
occurs O
across O
multiple O
cylinders O
and O
as O
less O
expansion O
now O
occurs O
in O
each O
cylinder O
less O
heat O
is O
lost O
by O
the O
steam O
in O
each O
. O

This O
reduces O
the O
magnitude O
of O
cylinder O
heating O
and O
cooling O
, O
increasing O
the O
efficiency O
of O
the O
engine O
. O

By O
staging O
the O
expansion O
in O

, O
torque B-KP
variability I-KP
can O
be O
reduced O
. O

To O
derive O

steam O
requires O
a O
larger O
cylinder B-KP
volume I-KP
as O
this O

Therefore O
, O
the O

cylinders O

The O
historical O
measure O
of O
a O

was O
its O
`` O
duty B-KP

The O
concept O

to O
illustrate O
how O
much O
more O

The O
best O
examples O
of O
Newcomen O

had O
a O
duty O
of O
about O
7 B-KP

most O
were O
closer O
to O
5 O

Watt O

original O

were O
able O
to O
deliver O
duty O
as O
high O

25 O
million O

averaged O
about O
17 B-KP

This O
was O
a O
three O

over O
the O

Newcomen O
design O

Early O
Watt O

this O

The O
first O

The O
centrifugal B-KP
governor I-KP
was O
adopted O
by O
James O
Watt O
for O
use O
on O
a O
steam O
engine O
in O
1788 O
after O
Watt O

partner O
Boulton B-KP
saw O
one O
at O
a B-KP
flour I-KP
mill I-KP
Boulton O
& O
Watt O
were O
building O
. O

The O
governor O
could O
not O
actually O
hold B-KP
a I-KP
set I-KP
speed I-KP
, O
because O
it O
would O
assume O
a O
new O
constant O
speed O
in O
response O
to O
load O
changes O
. O

The O
governor O
was O
able O
to O
handle O
smaller O
variations O
such O
as O
those O
caused O
by O
fluctuating O
heat O
load O
to O
the O
boiler O
. O

Also O
, O
there O
was O
a O
tendency O
for O
oscillation O
whenever O
there O
was O
a O
speed O
change O
. O

As O
a O
consequence O
, O
engines O
equipped O
only O
with O
this O
governor O
were O
not O
suitable O
for O
operations B-KP
requiring I-KP
constant I-KP
speed I-KP
, O
such O
as O
cotton B-KP
spinning I-KP
. O

The O
governor O
was O
improved O
over O
time O
and O
coupled O
with O
variable O
steam O
cut O
off O
, O
good O
speed O
control O
in O
response O
to O
changes O
in O
load O
was O
attainable O
near O
the O
end O
of O
the O
19th O
century O
. O

The O
adoption O
of O
compounding O
was O
common O
for O
industrial O
units O
, O
for O
road B-KP
engines I-KP
and O
almost O
universal O
for O
marine O
engines O
after O
1880 B-KP
; O
it O
was O
not O
universally O
popular O
in O
railway B-KP
locomotives I-KP
where O
it O
was O
often O
perceived O
as O
complicated B-KP
. O

This O
is O
partly O
due O
to O
the O
harsh O
railway O
operating O
environment O
and O
limited O
space O
afforded O
by O
the O
loading O
gauge O
( O
particularly O
in O
Britain O
, O
where O
compounding O
was O
never O
common O
and O
not O
employed O
after O
1930 B-KP
) O
. O

However O
, O
although O
never O
in O
the O
majority O
, O
it O
was O
popular O
in O
many O
other O
countries O
. O

The O
simplest O
valve O
gears O
give O
events O
of O
fixed B-KP
length O
during O
the O
engine O
cycle O
and O
often O
make O
the O
engine O
rotate O
in O
only O
one O
direction O
. O

Most O
however O
have O
a O
reversing O
mechanism O
which O
additionally O
can O
provide O
means O
for O
saving O
steam O
as O
speed O
and O

are O

by O
gradually O

In O

a O

used O
steam O
in O

water O
into O

, O
and O
then O

Thomas O
Newcomen O

atmospheric O
engine O
was O
the O
first O
commercial O
true O
steam O
engine O
using O
a O
piston O
, O
and O
was O
used O
in O
1712 B-KP
for O
pumping O
in O
a O

. O

A O
steam O
turbine O
consists O
of O
one O
or O
more O
rotors O
( O
rotating B-KP
discs I-KP
) O
mounted O
on O
a B-KP
drive B-KP
shaft I-KP
, O
alternating O
with O
a O
series O
of O
stators O
( O
static B-KP
discs I-KP
) I-KP
fixed O
to O
the B-KP
turbine I-KP
casing I-KP
. O

The O
rotors O
have O
a O
propeller O
like O
arrangement O
of O
blades O
at O
the O
outer O
edge O
. O

Steam O
acts O
upon O
these O
blades O
, O
producing O
rotary O
motion O
. O

The O
stator O
consists O
of O
a O
similar O
, O
but O
fixed O
, O
series O
of O
blades O
that O
serve O
to O
redirect O
the O
steam O
flow O
onto O
the O
next O
rotor O
stage O
. O

A O
steam O
turbine O
often O
exhausts O
into O
a O
surface O
condenser O
that O
provides O
a O
vacuum O
. O

The O
stages O
of O
a O
steam O
turbine O
are O
typically O
arranged O
to O
extract O
the O
maximum O
potential O
work O
from O
a O
specific O
velocity O
and O
pressure O
of O
steam O
, O
giving O
rise O
to O
a O
series O
of O
variably O
sized O
high O
and O
low O
pressure O
stages O
. O

Turbines O
are O
only O
efficient O
if O
they O
rotate O
at O
relatively O
high O
speed O
, O
therefore O
they O
are O
usually O
connected O
to O
reduction O
gearing O
to O
drive O
lower O
speed O
applications O
, O
such O
as O
a O
ship O
's O
propeller O
. O

In O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
large O
electric O
generating O
stations O
, O
turbines O
are O
directly O
connected O
to O
generators O
with O
no O
reduction O
gearing O
. O

Typical O
speeds O
are O
3600 B-KP
revolutions I-KP
per I-KP
minute I-KP
( O
RPM O
) O
in O
the O
USA O
with O
60 O
Hertz O
power O
, O
3000 O
RPM O
in O
Europe O
and O
other O
countries O
with O
50 O
Hertz O
electric O
power O
systems O
. O

In O
nuclear O
power O
applications O
the O
turbines O
typically O
run O
at O
half O
these O
speeds O
, O
1800 O
RPM O
and O
1500 O
RPM O
. O

A O
turbine O
rotor O
is O
also O
only O
capable O
of O
providing O
power O
when O
rotating O
in O
one O
direction O
. O

Therefore O
, O
a O
reversing O
stage O
or O
gearbox O
is O
usually O
required O
where O

is O
required O
in O
the O
opposite O

The O
next O
major O
step O
occurred O
when O
James O

developed O
( O
1763 B-KP

) O
an O
improved O
version O
of O
Newcomen O
's O
engine O
, O
with O
a B-KP
separate I-KP
condenser I-KP
. O

Boulton O
and O
Watt O

early O
engines O
used O
half B-KP
as I-KP
much I-KP
coal I-KP
as O
John O
Smeaton O

improved O
version O
of O
Newcomen B-KP

. O

Newcomen B-KP
's I-KP
and I-KP
Watt I-KP
's I-KP
early O
engines O
were O
`` O
atmospheric O
'' O
. O

They O
were O
powered O
by O
air O
pressure O
pushing O
a B-KP
piston I-KP
into O
the O
partial O
vacuum O
generated O
by O
condensing O
steam O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
pressure O
of O
expanding O
steam O
. O

The O
engine O
cylinders O
had O
to O
be O
large O
because O
the O
only O
usable O
force O
acting O
on O
them O
was O
due O
to O
atmospheric O
pressure O
. O

Steam O
engines O
frequently O
possess O
two B-KP
independent O
mechanisms O
for O
ensuring O
that O
the O
pressure O
in O
the O
boiler O
does O
not O
go O
too O
high O
; O
one O
may O
be O
adjusted O
by O
the O
user O
, O
the O
second O
is O
typically O
designed O
as O
an O
ultimate O
fail O
safe O
. O

Such O
safety O
valves O
traditionally O
used O
a O
simple O
lever O
to O
restrain O
a B-KP
plug I-KP
valve I-KP
in O
the O
top O
of O
a O
boiler O
. O

One O
end O
of O
the O
lever O
carried O
a O
weight O
or O
spring O
that O
restrained O
the O
valve O
against O
steam O
pressure O
. O

Early O
valves O
could O
be O
adjusted O
by O
engine O
drivers O
, O
leading O
to O
many O
accidents O
when O
a O
driver O
fastened O
the O
valve O
down O
to O
allow O
greater B-KP
steam I-KP
pressure I-KP
and I-KP
more I-KP
power I-KP
from O
the O
engine O
. O

The O
more O
recent O
type O
of O
safety O
valve O
uses O
an O
adjustable B-KP
spring I-KP
loaded I-KP
valve I-KP
, O
which O
is O
locked O
such O
that O
operators O
may O
not O
tamper O
with O
its O
adjustment O
unless O
a B-KP
seal I-KP

broken O

This O
arrangement O

however O

the O

Watt O
was O
also O
aware O

the O

the O

. O

One O
of O
the O
principal O
advantages O
the O
Rankine O
cycle O
holds O
over O
others O
is O
that O
during B-KP
the I-KP

relatively I-KP
little I-KP
work I-KP
is I-KP
required I-KP
to I-KP

the O

this O
point O

By O
condensing O
the O

, O
the O
work O
required O

the O

consumes O
only O
1 B-KP
% I-KP

3 I-KP

of O
the O

power O

contributes O
to O
a O
much O
higher O

for O
a O

The O
benefit O

In O

Philo O
incorrectly B-KP

Oxygen O
was O
discovered O
independently O
by O
Carl O
Wilhelm O
Scheele O
, O
in O
Uppsala O
, O
in O
1773 B-KP
or I-KP
earlier I-KP
, O
and O
Joseph O
Priestley O
in O
Wiltshire O
, O
in O
1774 B-KP
, O
but O
Priestley O
is O
often O
given O
priority O
because O
his B-KP
work I-KP
was I-KP
published B-KP
first I-KP
. O

The O
name O
oxygen O
was O
coined O
in O
1777 O
by O
Antoine B-KP
Lavoisier B-KP
, O
whose O
experiments O
with O
oxygen O
helped O
to O
discredit O
the O
then O
popular O
phlogiston B-KP
theory I-KP
of I-KP
combustion I-KP
and I-KP
corrosion I-KP
. O

Its O
name O
derives O
from O
the O
Greek O
roots O
oxys O
, O
`` O
acid O
'' O
, O
literally O
`` O
sharp O
'' O
, O
referring O
to O
the O
sour O
taste O
of O
acids O
and O
genes O
, O
`` O
producer O
'' O
, O
literally O
`` O
begetter O
'' O
, O
because O
at O
the O
time O
of O
naming O
, O
it O
was O
mistakenly O
thought O
that O
all O
acids O
required O
oxygen O
in O
their O
composition O
. O

Common O
uses O
of O
oxygen O
includes O
the O
production O

Hence O

only O
slowly O
with O

this O
prevents O
spontaneous B-KP
combustion I-KP

In O
one O
experiment O
, O
Lavoisier O
observed O
that O
there O
was O
no O
overall O
increase O
in O
weight O
when O
tin O
and O
air O
were O
heated O
in O
a O
closed O

. O

He O
noted O
that O
air B-KP
rushed O
in O
when O
he O
opened O
the O
container O
, O
which O
indicated O
that O
part B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
trapped I-KP
air B-KP
had O
been O
consumed O
. O

He O
also O
noted O
that O
the B-KP
tin I-KP
had I-KP
increased I-KP
in I-KP
weight B-KP
and I-KP
that I-KP
increase I-KP
was I-KP
the I-KP
same I-KP
as I-KP
the I-KP
weight B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
air I-KP
that I-KP
rushed I-KP
back I-KP
in I-KP
. O

This O

The O

By O
the O
end O

the O

in O

1974 O
, O
the O
price O

nearly B-KP

; O
US O

The O
crisis O
had O
a O
major O

created O
a O

Some O
European O

sought O

the O

The O

was O
enough O
to O
convince O
Arab O

lift O
the O

in O
March B-KP
1974 I-KP
. I-KP

On B-KP
August B-KP

1971 I-KP

The O
US O
abandoned O

The O

Anticipating O
that O

the B-KP

The O
result O
was O
a O
depreciation O
of O
the O

Because B-KP

they O
would O

This O
contributed O
to O
the O
`` O

'' O
. O

After B-KP
1971 B-KP

OPEC O

From O

Until B-KP
the B-KP

the O

also O
remained O

had O
not O
developed O

to O

so O
their O

The O
substantial O
price O

of O
1973 B-KP

largely O
returned O
their O

'' O

Silverstein O
chose O
the O

Up O

Kennedy O
had O
been O
speaking O
out O
against O
the O
`` O
missile B-KP

'' O
that O
he O
and O
many O
other O

felt O

to O
the O

Beyond O
military O
power O

Kennedy O
used O
aerospace O

'' O

Despite O
Kennedy O

rhetoric O
, O
he O
did O
not O
immediately O
come O
to O
a O
decision O
on O
the O
status O
of O
the O
Apollo O

once O
he O
became O

He O
knew O
little O
about O
the O

was O
put O
off O
by O
the O
massive B-KP

commitment I-KP
required O
by O
a O
manned O
Moon O
landing O

When O
Kennedy O

newly O
appointed O
NASA O
Administrator O
James B-KP
E. I-KP
Webb I-KP
requested O
a O
30 O
percent O
budget O
increase O
for O
his O
agency O
, O
Kennedy O
supported O
an O
acceleration O
of O
NASA O

large O

program O

deferred O
a O
decision O
on O
the O
broader O
issue O

On O
April O
12 O
, O
1961 O
, O
Soviet B-KP
cosmonaut O
Yuri B-KP
Gagarin I-KP
became O
the O
first O

to O
fly O
in O

, O
reinforcing O
American O
fears O
about O

left O
behind O
in O
a O
technological O
competition O
with O
the O
Soviet B-KP
Union I-KP
. O

At O
a O
meeting O
of O
the O
US O
House O
Committee O
on O
Science O
and O
Astronautics O
one B-KP
day I-KP
after O
Gagarin O

flight O
, O
many O
congressmen O
pledged O
their O
support O
for O
a O
crash O
program O
aimed O
at O
ensuring O
that O
America O
would O
catch O
up O

Kennedy O
was O
circumspect O
in O
his O
response O
to O
the O
news O
, O
refusing B-KP
to I-KP
make I-KP
a I-KP
commitment I-KP
on I-KP
America I-KP

response I-KP
to O
the O
Soviets O
. O

On O
April B-KP
20 I-KP
, O
Kennedy O
sent O
a O
memo O
to O
Vice O
President O
Lyndon B-KP
B. I-KP
Johnson I-KP

asking O
Johnson O
to O
look O
into O
the O
status O

, O
and O
into O
programs O
that O
could O
offer O
NASA O
the O
opportunity O
to O
catch O
up O

Johnson O
responded O
approximately B-KP
one B-KP
week I-KP
later O
, O
concluding O
that O
`` O
we B-KP
are I-KP
neither I-KP
making I-KP

reach I-KP
a I-KP

'' O

His O
memo O
concluded O
that O
a O
manned O
Moon O
landing O
was O
far O
enough O
in O
the O
future O
that O
it O
was O
likely O
the O
United O

would O
achieve O
it O
first O
. O

It O
became O
clear O
that O
managing O
the O
Apollo O
program O
would O
exceed O
the O
capabilities O
of O
Robert B-KP
R. I-KP
Gilruth I-KP
's I-KP
Space O
Task O
Group O
, O
which O
had O
been O
directing O

program O
from O
NASA B-KP

Langley B-KP
Research I-KP
Center I-KP

So O
Gilruth O
was O
given O
authority O
to O
grow O
his O
organization O
into O
a O
new O
NASA O
center O
, O
the O
Manned O
Spacecraft O
Center O
( O
MSC O

. O

A O
site O
was O
chosen O
in O

on O

donated O
by O
Rice B-KP
University I-KP
, O
and O
Administrator O
Webb O
announced O
the O
conversion O
on O
September O
19 O
, O
1961 O
. O

It O
was O
also O
clear O
NASA O
would O
soon O
outgrow O
its O
practice O
of O
controlling O
missions O
from O
its O
Cape O
Canaveral O
Air O
Force O
Station O
launch O
facilities O
in O
Florida B-KP
, O
so O
a O
new O
Mission O
Control O
Center O
would O
be O
included O
in O
the O
MSC O
. O

It O
also O
became O
clear O
that O
Apollo O
would O
outgrow O
the O
Canaveral O
launch O
facilities O
in O
Florida B-KP

The O
two O

at O
the O
northernmost O

LC O
34 O

. O

But O
an O
even O
bigger O
facility O
would O
be O
needed O
for O
the O
mammoth O
rocket O
required O
for O
the O
manned O
lunar O
mission O
, O
so O
land O
acquisition O
was O
started O
in O
July O
1961 O
for O
a O
Launch O
Operations O

Construction O
began O
in O
November O
1962 O

Upon O
Kennedy O

death O
, O
President O

issued O
an O

order O
on O
November O
29 O

1963 O
, O
to O
rename O
the O
LOC O

then O
moved O

Although O
at O

, O
only O
two O

Administrator O
Webb O
realized O
that O
in O

, O
he O
had O
to O
develop O

Based O
on O
his O

, O
Mueller O
realized O

under O
him O
, O
on O
the O
condition O
that O

Mueller O
agreed O
, O
and O
Phillips O
managed O
Apollo O
from B-KP
January B-KP
1964 I-KP
, I-KP
until I-KP
it I-KP
achieved I-KP
the I-KP
first I-KP
manned I-KP
landing I-KP
in I-KP
July I-KP
1969 I-KP
, I-KP
after O
which O
he O
returned O
to O
Air O
Force O
duty O
. O

In O
early O
1961 B-KP
, O
direct O
ascent O
was O
generally O
the O
mission O
mode O
in O
favor O
at O
NASA O
. O

Many O
engineers O
feared O
that O
a B-KP
rendezvous B-KP
let I-KP
alone I-KP
a I-KP
docking B-KP
neither O
of O
which O
had O
been O
attempted O
even O
in O

, O
would O
be O
extremely O
difficult O
in O
lunar O
orbit O
. O

Dissenters O
including O
John O
Houbolt O
at O
Langley O
Research O
Center O
emphasized O
the O
important O
weight O
reductions O
that O
were O
offered O
by O
the O
LOR O
approach O
. O

Throughout O
1960 B-KP
and O
1961 O
, O
Houbolt O
campaigned O
for O
the O
recognition O
of O
LOR O
as O
a O
viable O
and O
practical O
option O
. O

Bypassing O
the O
NASA O
hierarchy O
, O
he O
sent O
a O
series O
of O
memos O
and O
reports O
on O
the O
issue O
to O
Associate O
Administrator O
Robert B-KP
Seamans I-KP
; I-KP
while O
acknowledging O
that O
he O
spoke O
`` O
somewhat O
as O
a O
voice O
in O
the O
wilderness O
, O
'' O
Houbolt O
pleaded O
that O
LOR O
should O
not O
be O
discounted O
in O
studies O
of O
the O
question O
. O

Seamans O
' O
establishment O
of O
an O

headed O
by O
his O
special O
technical O
assistant O
Nicholas B-KP
E. I-KP
Golovin I-KP
in O
July B-KP
1961 B-KP
, O
to O
recommend O
a O

used O
in O
the O
Apollo O
program O
, O
represented O
a O
turning O
point O
in O
NASA O

mission O
mode O
decision O
. O

This O
committee O
recognized O
that O
the O
chosen O
mode O
was O
an O
important O
part O
of O
the O
launch O
vehicle O
choice O
, O
and O
recommended O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
hybrid O
EOR O
LOR O
mode O
. O

Its O
consideration O
of O
LOR O
as O
well O
as O
Houbolt O
's O
ceaseless O
work O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
publicizing O
the O
workability O
of O
the O

. O

In O
late O
1961 O
and O
early O
1962 O
, O
members O
of O
the O
Manned B-KP

began O
to O
come O
around O

, B-KP
Joseph I-KP
Shea I-KP

The O
engineers O
at O
Marshall B-KP
Space I-KP

Center I-KP
( I-KP

took O
longer O
to O

convinced O
of O
its O

, O
but O
their O
conversion O
was O
announced O
by O
Wernher O
von O
Braun O
at O
a O
briefing O
in O
June O
1962 O
. O

But O
even O
after O
NASA O
reached O
internal O
agreement O
, O
it O
was O
far O
from O
smooth O
sailing O
. O

Kennedy O

science O
advisor O
Jerome B-KP
Wiesner I-KP
, O
who O
had O
expressed O
his O
opposition O
to O
manned O
spaceflight O
to O
Kennedy O
before O
the O
President O
took O
office O
, O
and O
had O
opposed O
the O
decision O
to O
land O
men O
on O
the O
Moon O
, O
hired O
Golovin B-KP
, O
who O
had O
left O
NASA B-KP
, O
to O
chair O
his O
own O
`` O
Space O
Vehicle O
Panel O
'' O
, O
ostensibly O
to O
monitor O
, O
but O
actually O
to O
second O
guess O
NASA O
's O
decisions O
on O
the O
Saturn O
V O
launch O
vehicle O
and O
LOR O
by O
forcing O
Shea O
, O
Seamans O
, O
and O
even O
Webb O
to O
defend O
themselves O
, O
delaying O
its O
formal O
announcement O
to O
the O
press O
on O
July B-KP
11 I-KP
, I-KP
1962 I-KP
, O
and O
forcing O
Webb O
to O
still O
hedge O
the O
decision O
as O
`` O
tentative O
'' O
. O

Wiesner B-KP
kept O
up O
the O
pressure O
, O
even O
making O
the O
disagreement O
public O
during O
a O
two O
day O
September O
visit O
by O
the O
President O
to O
Marshall O
Space O
Flight O
Center O
. O

Wiesner B-KP
blurted O
out O
`` O
No B-KP
, I-KP
that I-KP
's I-KP
no I-KP
good I-KP
'' O
in O
front O
of O
the O
press O
, O
during O
a O
presentation O
by O
von O
Braun O
. O

Webb O
jumped O
in O
and O
defended O
von O
Braun O
, O
until O
Kennedy O
ended O
the O
squabble O
by O
stating O
that O
the O
matter O
was O
`` O
still O
subject O
to O
final O
review O
'' O
. O

Webb O
held O
firm O
, O
and O
issued O
a O
request O
for O
proposal O
to O
candidate O
Lunar B-KP
Excursion I-KP
Module I-KP
( O
LEM O
) O
contractors O
. O

Wiesner O
finally O
relented O
, O
unwilling O
to O
settle O
the O
dispute O
once O
and O
for O
all O
in O
Kennedy O
's O
office O
, O
because O
of O
the O
President O
's O
involvement O
with O
the O
October O
Cuban O
missile O
crisis O
, O
and O
fear O
of O
Kennedy O
's O
support O
for O
Webb O
. O

NASA O
announced O
the O
selection O
of O
Grumman B-KP
as O
the O
LEM O
contractor O
in O
November O
1962 O
. O

The O
LOR O
method O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
allowing B-KP
the I-KP
lander I-KP
spacecraft I-KP
to I-KP
be I-KP
used I-KP
as I-KP
a I-KP
`` I-KP
lifeboat I-KP
'' I-KP
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
failure O
of O
the O
command O
ship O
. O

Some O
documents O
prove O
this O
theory O
was O
discussed O
before O
and O
after O
the O
method O
was O
chosen O
. O

A O
1964 B-KP
MSC O
study O
concluded O
, O
`` O

'' O

Ironically O
, O
just O
such O
a O
failure O
happened O
on O
Apollo B-KP
13 I-KP
when O
an O
oxygen O
tank O
explosion O
left O
the O

Since O
Ireland B-KP
refused O
to O
consent O
to O
changes O
in O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Lisbon O
2007 O
, O
there O
remains O
one B-KP
Commissioner I-KP
for I-KP
each I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
28 I-KP
member I-KP

the O
High O

Policy O
( O

. O

The O
Commissioners O
( O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
the O
portfolios O
they O
will O
hold O
) O
are O
bargained O
over O
intensively O
by O
the O
member O

. O

The O
Commissioners O
, O
as O
a O
block O
, O
are O
then O
subject O
to O
a O
qualified O
majority O
vote O
of O
the O
Council O
to O
approve O
, O
and O
majority O
approval O
of O
the O
Parliament O
. O

The O
proposal O
to O
make O
the O
Commissioners O
be O
drawn O
from O
the O
elected O
Parliament O
, O
was O
not O
adopted O
in O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Lisbon O
. O

This O
means O
Commissioners B-KP
are O
, O
through O
the O
appointment O
process O
, O
the O
unelected O
subordinates O
of O
member O
state O
governments O
. O

Commissioners O
have O
various O
privileges O
, O
such O
as O
being O
exempt O
from O
member O
state O
taxes O
( O
but O
not O
EU O
taxes O
) O
, O
and O
having O
immunity O
from O
prosecution O
for O
doing O
official O
acts O
. O

Commissioners O
have O
sometimes O
been O
found O
to O
have O
abused O
their O
offices O
, O
particularly O
since O
the B-KP
Santer I-KP
Commission I-KP
was O
censured O
by O
Parliament O
in O
1999 B-KP
, O
and O
it O
eventually O
resigned O
due O
to O
corruption O
allegations O
. O

This O
resulted O
in O
one O
main O
case O
, O
Commission B-KP
v I-KP
Edith I-KP
Cresson I-KP
where O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
Commissioner O
giving O
her O
dentist O
a O
job O
, O
for O
which O
he O
was O
clearly O
unqualified O
, O
did B-KP
in I-KP
fact I-KP
not B-KP
break I-KP
any I-KP
law I-KP
. O

By O
contrast O
to O
the O
ECJ O
's O
relaxed O
approach O
, O
a B-KP
Committee B-KP
of I-KP
Independent I-KP
Experts I-KP
found O
that O
a O
culture O
had O
developed O
where O
few O
Commissioners O
had O
even O
the O
slightest O
sense O
of O
responsibility O
. O

This O
led O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Anti I-KP
fraud I-KP
Office I-KP
. O

In O
2012 B-KP
it O
investigated O
the O
Maltese O
Commissioner O
for O
Health O
, O
John O
Dalli O
, O
who O
quickly O
resigned O
after O
allegations O
that O
he O
received O
a O
60m O
bribe O
in O
connection O
with O
a O
Tobacco O
Products O
Directive O
. O

Beyond O
the O
Commission O
, O
the O
European O
Central O
Bank O
has O
relative O
executive O
autonomy O
in O
its O
conduct O
of O
monetary O
policy O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
managing O
the O
euro O
. O

It O
has O
a O
six O
person O
board O
appointed O
by O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Council I-KP
, O
on O
the O
Council O
's O
recommendation O
. O

The O
President O
of O
the O
Council O
and O
a O
Commissioner O
can O
sit O
in O
on O
ECB O
meetings O
, O
but O
do B-KP
not B-KP
have I-KP
voting I-KP
rights I-KP
. O

While O
the B-KP
Commission I-KP
has O
a O
monopoly O
on O
initiating O
legislation O
, O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Parliament I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
Council I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
European I-KP
Union I-KP
have O
powers O
of O
amendment O
and O
veto O
during O
the O
legislative O
process O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Treaty O
on O
European O
Union O
articles O
9 O
and O
10 O
, O
the O
EU O
observes O
`` O
the O
principle O
of O
equality O
of O
its O
citizens O
'' O
and O
is O
meant O
to O
be O
founded O
on O
`` O
representative O
democracy O
'' O
. O

In O
practice O
, O
equality O
and O
democracy O
are O
deficient O
because O
the O
elected O
representatives O
in O
the O
Parliament B-KP
can B-KP
not I-KP
initiate I-KP
legislation I-KP
against I-KP
the I-KP
Commission I-KP
's I-KP
wishes I-KP
, O
citizens O
of O
smallest O
countries O
have O
ten O
times O
the O
voting O
weight O
in O
Parliament O
as O
citizens O
of O
the O
largest O
countries O
, O
and O
`` O
qualified O
majorities O
'' O
or O
consensus O
of O
the O
Council O
are O
required O
to O
legislate O
. O

The O
justification O
for O
this O
`` O
democratic O
deficit O
'' O
under O
the O
Treaties O
is O
usually O
thought O
to O
be O
that O
completion O
integration O
of O
the O
European O
economy O
and O
political O
institutions O
required O
the O
technical O
coordination O
of O
experts O
, O
while O
popular O
understanding O
of O
the O
EU O
developed O
and O
nationalist O
sentiments O
declined O
post O
war O
. O

Over O
time O
, O
this O
has O
meant O
the O
Parliament O
gradually O
assumed O
more O
voice O
: O
from O
being O
an O
unelected O
assembly O
, O
to O
its O
first O
direct O
elections O
in O
1979 B-KP
, O
to O
having O
increasingly O
more O
rights O
in O
the O
legislative O
process O
. O

Citizens O
' O
rights O
are O
therefore O
limited O
compared O
to O
the O
democratic O
polities O
within O
all O
European O
member O
states O
: O
under O
TEU O
article O
11 O
citizens O
and O

have O
the O
rights O
such O
as O

and O
submit O
an O

that O
must O
be O
considered O
by O
the O
Commission O
with O
one O
million O
signatures O
. O

TFEU O
article O
227 O
contains O
a O
further O
right O
for O
citizens O
to O
petition O
the O
Parliament O
on O

do O
not O
receive O

EU O
, O
as O
the O
Court O
of O

held O
in O
Parti O

`` O

'' O
v O

that O

to O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
Parliament O
has O
explicit O
consultation O
rights O
, O
which O
the O
Commission O
must O
genuinely O
follow O
. O

However O
its O
role O
participation O
in O
the O
legislative O
process O
still O
remains O
limited O
because O
no O
member O
can O
actually O
or O
pass O

without O
the B-KP
Commission I-KP

meaning O
power O
( O
`` O

is O
not O

elected O
representatives O

The O

In O
fact O
, O
most O
EU O
law O
is O
applied O
by O
member B-KP
state I-KP
courts I-KP
( O
the O
English O

the O
German O

but O
they O
can O
refer O
questions O
to O
the O
EU O
court O
for O
a O
preliminary O
ruling O

The O
CJEU O
's O
duty O
is O
to B-KP
`` I-KP
ensure I-KP
that I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
interpretation I-KP
and I-KP
application I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP

the I-KP

is I-KP
observed I-KP

, O
although O
realistically O
it O
has B-KP
the I-KP
ability I-KP
to I-KP
expand I-KP

develop I-KP
the I-KP
law I-KP
according I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
principles I-KP
it I-KP
deems I-KP
to I-KP
be I-KP
appropriate I-KP
. O

Arguably O
this O
has O
been O
done O
through O
both O
seminal O
and O
controversial O
judgments O
, O
including O
Van O

, O
Mangold O

Since O
its O
founding O
, O
the O
EU O
has O
operated O
among O
an O
increasing O
plurality O
of O
national O
and O
globalising O
legal O
systems O
. O

This O
has O
meant O
both O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
highest I-KP
national I-KP
courts I-KP
have O
had O
to O
develop O
principles O
to O
resolve O
conflicts O
of O
laws O
between O
different O
systems O
. O

Within O
the O
EU O
itself O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
's O
view O
is O
that O
if O
EU B-KP
law I-KP
conflicts O
with O
a O
provision O
of O
national O
law O
, O
then O
EU B-KP
law I-KP
has I-KP
primacy I-KP
. O

In O
the O
first O
major O
case O
in O
1964 B-KP
, O
Costa O
v O
ENEL O
, O
a O
Milanese O
lawyer O
, O
and O
former O
shareholder O
of O
an O
energy O
company O
, O
named O
Mr O
Costa O
refused O
to O
pay O
his O
electricity O
bill O
to O
Enel O
, O
as O
a O
protest O
against O
the O
nationalisation O
of O
the O
Italian O
energy O
corporations O
. O

He O
claimed O
the O
Italian O
nationalisation O
law O
conflicted O
with O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Rome O
, O
and O
requested O
a O
reference O
be O
made O
to O
both O
the O
Italian O
Constitutional O
Court O
and O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
under O
TFEU O
article O
267 O
. O

The B-KP
Italian I-KP
Constitutional I-KP
Court I-KP
gave O
an O
opinion O
that O
because B-KP
the I-KP
nationalisation I-KP
law I-KP
was I-KP
from I-KP
1962 I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
treaty I-KP
was I-KP
in I-KP
force I-KP
from I-KP
1958 I-KP
, I-KP
Costa I-KP
had I-KP
no I-KP
claim I-KP
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
the B-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
held O
that O
ultimately O
the O
Treaty O
of O
Rome O
in O
no O
way O
prevented O
energy O
nationalisation O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
under O
the O
Treaty O
provisions O
only O
the O
Commission O
could O
have O
brought O
a O
claim O
, O
not O
Mr O
Costa O
. O

However O
, O
in O
principle O
, O
Mr O
Costa O
was O
entitled O
to O
plead O
that O
the O
Treaty O
conflicted O
with O
national O
law O
, O
and O
the O
court O
would O
have O
a O
duty O
to O
consider O
his O
claim O
to O
make O
a O
reference O
if O
there O
would O
be O
no O
appeal O
against O
its O
decision O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
repeating O
its O
view O
in O
Van O
Gend O
en O
Loos O
, O
said O
member O
states O
`` O
albeit O
within O
limited O
spheres O
, O
have O
restricted O

to O
their O
nationals O
and O
to O
themselves O
'' O
on O
the O
`` O

of O

EU O

not O
`` O

, O
however O

without O
the O

of O

called O

'' O

This O
meant O
any O
`` O
subsequent O

'' O
of O
the O

inapplicable O

Similarly O
, O
in O
Amministrazione O
delle O
Finanze O
v O
Simmenthal O
SpA O
, O
a O
company O
, O
Simmenthal O
SpA O
, O
claimed O
that O
a O
public O
health O
inspection O
fee O
under O
an O
Italian O
law O
of O
1970 O
for O
importing O
beef O
from O
France O
to O
Italy O
was O
contrary O
to O
two O
Regulations O
from O
1964 B-KP
and I-KP
1968 I-KP
. O

In O
`` O
accordance O
with O
the O
principle O
of O
the O
precedence O
of O
Community O
law O
, O
'' O
said O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
the O
`` O
directly O
applicable O
measures O
of O
the O
institutions O
'' O
( O
such O
as O
the O
Regulations O
in O
the O

) O
`` O
render O
automatically O
inapplicable O
any O
conflicting O
provision O
of O

'' O
. O

This O
was O
necessary O
to O
prevent O
a O
`` O

denial O
'' O
of O
Treaty O
`` O

that O

`` O

But O
despite O
the O
views O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
the O
national O
courts O
of O
member O
states O
have O
not O
accepted O
the O
same O
analysis O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
while O
all O
member O
states O
recognise O
that O
EU B-KP
law I-KP
takes O
primacy O
over O
national O
law O
where O
this O
agreed O
in O
the O
Treaties O
, O
they O
do O
not O
accept O
that O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
has O
the O
final O
say O
on B-KP
foundational I-KP
constitutional I-KP
questions I-KP
affecting I-KP
democracy I-KP
and I-KP
human I-KP
rights I-KP
. O

In O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
, O
the O
basic O
principle O
is O
that O
Parliament O
, O
as O
the O
sovereign O
expression O
of O
democratic O
legitimacy O
, O
can O
decide O
whether O
it O
wishes O
to O
expressly O
legislate O
against O
EU O
law O
. O

This O
, O
however O
, O
would O
only O
happen O
in O
the O
case O
of O
an O
express O
wish O
of O
the O
people O
to O
withdraw O
from O
the O
EU O

It O
was O
held O
in O
R O
( O
Factortame O

) O
v O
Secretary O

that O
`` O

when O
it O

the O
European O

1972 B-KP
was O
entirely O
voluntary O
'' O
and O
so O
`` O
it O
has O
always O
been O
clear O
'' O
that O
UK O

have O
a O
duty O
`` O
to O

of O

'' O

More O
recently O
the O
UK O
Supreme O
Court O
noted O
that O
in O
R O
( O
HS2 O
Action O
Alliance O
Ltd O
) O
v O
Secretary O
of O
State O
for O
Transport O
, O
although O
the O
UK O
constitution O
is O
uncodified O
, O
there O
could O
be O
`` O
fundamental O
principles O
'' O
of O
common O
law O
, O
and O
Parliament O
`` O
did O
not O
either O
contemplate O
or O
authorise O
the O
abrogation O
'' O
of O
those O
principles O
when O
it O
enacted O
the O
European O
Communities O
Act O
1972 B-KP
. O

The O
view O
of O
the O
German O
Constitutional O
Court O
from O
the O
Solange O
I O
and O
Solange O
II O
decisions O
is O
that O
if B-KP
the I-KP
EU I-KP
does I-KP
not I-KP
comply I-KP
with I-KP
its I-KP
basic I-KP
constitutional I-KP
rights I-KP
and I-KP
principles I-KP
( O
particularly O
democracy O
, O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
and O
the O
social O
state O
principles O
) O
then O
it O
can O
not O
override O
German O
law O
. O

However O
, O
as O
the O
nicknames O
of O
the O
judgments O
go O
, O
`` O
so O
long O
as O
'' O
the O
EU O
works O
towards O
the O
democratisation O
of O
its O
institutions O
, O
and O
has O
a O
framework O
that O
protects O
fundamental O
human O
rights O
, O
it O
would O
not O
review O
EU O
legislation O
for O
compatibility O
with O
German O
constitutional O
principles O
. O

Most O
other O
member O
states O
have O
expressed O
similar O
reservations O
. O

This O
suggests O
the O
EU O
's O
legitimacy O
rests O
on O
the B-KP
ultimate I-KP
authority I-KP
of I-KP
member I-KP
states I-KP
, I-KP
its I-KP
factual I-KP
commitment I-KP
to I-KP
human I-KP
rights I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
democratic I-KP
will I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
people I-KP
. I-KP

While O
constitutional B-KP
law I-KP
concerns O
the O
European O
Union O
's O
governance O
structure O
, O
administrative B-KP
law I-KP
binds O
EU O
institutions O
and O
member O
states O
to O
follow O
the O
law O
. O

Both O
member O
states O
and O
the O
Commission O
have O
a O
general O
legal O
right O
or O
`` O
standing O
'' O
( O
locus O
standi O
) O
to O
bring O
claims O
against O
EU O
institutions O
and O
other O
member O
states O
for O
breach O
of O
the O
treaties O
. O

From O
the O
EU O
's O
foundation O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
also O
held O
that O
the O
Treaties O
allowed O
citizens O
or O
corporations O
to O
bring O
claims O
against O
EU O
and O
member O
state O
institutions O
for O
violation O
of O
the O
Treaties O
and O
Regulations O
, O
if O
they O
were O
properly O
interpreted O
as O
creating O
rights O
and O
obligations O
. O

However O
, O
under O
Directives O
, O
citizens O
or O
corporations O
were O
said O
in O
1986 B-KP
to O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
bring O
claims O
against O
other O
non O
state O
parties O
. O

This O
meant O
courts O
of O
member O
states O
were O
not O
bound O
to O
apply O
an O
EU O
law O
where O
a O
national O
rule O
conflicted O
, O
even O
though O
the O
member O
state O
government O
could O
be O
sued O
, O
if O
it O
would O
impose O
an O
obligation O
on O
another O
citizen O
or O
corporation O
. O

These O
rules O
on O
`` O
direct O
effect O
'' O
limit O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
member O
state O
courts O
are O
bound O
to O
administer O
EU O
law O
. O

All B-KP
actions I-KP
by I-KP
EU I-KP
institutions I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
subject I-KP
to I-KP
judicial I-KP
review I-KP
, O
and O
judged O
by O
standards O
of O
proportionality O
, O
particularly O
where O
general O
principles O
of O
law O
, O
or O
fundamental O
rights O
are O
engaged O
. O

The O
remedy O
for O
a O
claimant O
where O
there O
has O
been O
a O
breach O
of O
the O
law O
is O
often O
monetary O
damages O
, O
but O
courts O
can O
also O
require O
specific O
performance O
or O
will O
grant O
an O
injunction O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
the O
law O
is O
effective O
as O
possible O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
generally O
accepted O
that O
EU O
law O
has O
primacy O
, O
not O
all O
EU O
laws O
give O
citizens O
standing O
to O
bring O
claims O
: O
that O
is O

not O
all O
EU O

Van O

Loos O
, O
a B-KP
postal I-KP
company I-KP
, O
claimed O
that O
what O
is O
now O
TFEU B-KP
article I-KP

prevented O

when O
it O

. O

After O
a O
Dutch O
court O
made O
a O
reference O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
even O
though O
the O

did O
not O
`` O

'' O
confer O
a O
right O
on O

they O
could O

Historically O

international O

had O
only O
allowed O

proclaimed O
`` O

Because O
article B-KP

clearly O

EU B-KP
Regulations I-KP
are I-KP
the I-KP
same I-KP
as I-KP
Treaty I-KP
provisions I-KP
in I-KP
this I-KP
sense I-KP
, I-KP
because I-KP
as I-KP
TFEU I-KP
article I-KP
288 I-KP
states I-KP
, I-KP
they B-KP
are I-KP
directly I-KP
applicable I-KP
in I-KP
all I-KP
Member I-KP
States I-KP
. O

Moreover O
, O
member O
states O
comes O
under O
a O
duty O
not O
to O
replicate O
Regulations O
in O
their O
own O
law O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
confusion O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Commission O
v O
Italy O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Italy O
had O
breached O
a O
duty O
under O
the O
Treaties O
, O
both O
by O
failing O
to O
operate O
a O
scheme O
to O
pay O
farmers O
a O
premium O
to O
slaughter O
cows O
( O
to O
reduce O
dairy O
overproduction O
) O
, O
and O
by O
reproducing O
the O
rules O
in O
a O
decree O
with O
various O
additions O
. O

`` O
Regulations O
, O
'' O
held O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
`` O
come O
into O
force O
solely O
by O
virtue O
of O
their O
publication O
'' O
and O
implementation O
could O
have O
the O
effect O
of O
`` O
jeopardizing O
their O
simultaneous O
and O
uniform O
application O
in O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
Union O
. O
'' O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
some O
Regulations O
may O
themselves O
expressly O
require O
implementing O
measures O
, O
in O
which O
case O
those O
specific O
rules O
should O
be O
followed O
. O

While O
the O
Treaties O
and O
Regulations O
will O
have O
direct O
effect O
( O
if O
clear O
, O
unconditional O
and O
immediate O
) O
, O
Directives B-KP
do O
not O
generally O
give O
citizens O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
the O
member O
state O
) O
standing O
to O
sue O
other O
citizens O
. O

In O
theory O
, O
this O
is O
because O
TFEU O
article O
288 O
says O
Directives O
are O
addressed O
to O
the O
member O
states O
and O
usually O
`` O
leave O
to O
the O
national O
authorities O
the O
choice O
of O
form O
and O
methods O
'' O
to O
implement O
. O

In O
part O
this O
reflects O
that O
directives O
often O
create O
minimum O
standards O
, O
leaving O
member O
states O
to O
apply O
higher O
standards O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
Working O
Time O
Directive O
requires O
that O
every O
worker O
has O
at O
least O
4 B-KP
weeks I-KP
paid I-KP
holidays I-KP
each I-KP
year I-KP
, O
but O
most O
member O
states O
require O
more B-KP
than I-KP
28 I-KP
days I-KP
in O
national O
law O
. O

However O
, O
on O
the O
current O
position O
adopted O
by O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
citizens O
have O
standing O
to O
make O
claims O
based O
on O
national O
laws O
that O
implement O
Directives O
, O
but O
not O
from O
Directives O
themselves O
. O

Directives O
do O
not O
have O
so O
called O
`` O
horizontal O
'' O
direct O
effect O
( O
i.e O
. O

between O
non O
state O
parties O
) O
. O

This O
view O
was O
instantly O
controversial O
, O
and O
in O
the B-KP
early B-KP
1990s I-KP
three O
Advocate O
Generals O
persuasively O
argued O
that O
Directives O
should O
create O
rights O
and O
duties O
for O
all O
citizens O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
refused O
, O
but O
there O
are O
five O
large O
exceptions O
. O

First O
, O
if O
a O
Directive O
's O
deadline O
for O
implementation O
is O
not O
met O
, O
the B-KP
member I-KP
state I-KP
can I-KP
not I-KP
enforce I-KP
conflicting I-KP
laws I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
a B-KP
citizen I-KP
may I-KP
rely I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
Directive I-KP
in I-KP
such I-KP
an I-KP
action I-KP
( I-KP
so I-KP
called I-KP
`` I-KP
vertical I-KP
'' I-KP
direct I-KP
effect I-KP
) I-KP
. O

So O
, O
in O
Pubblico O
Ministero O
v O
Ratti O
because O
the O
Italian O
government O
had O
failed O
to O
implement O
a O
Directive O
73/173/EEC O
on O
packaging O
and O
labelling O
solvents O
by O
the O
deadline O
, O
it O
was O
estopped O
from O
enforcing O
a O
conflicting O
national O
law O
from O
1963 O
against O
Mr O
Ratti O
's O
solvent O
and O
varnish O
business O
. O

A O
member O
state O
could O
`` O
not O
rely O
, O
as O
against O
individuals O
, O
on O
its O
own O
failure O
to O
perform O
the O
obligations O
which O
the O
Directive O
entails O
. O
'' O

Second O
, O
a B-KP
citizen I-KP
or I-KP
company I-KP
can I-KP
invoke I-KP
a I-KP
Directive I-KP
, I-KP
not I-KP
just I-KP
in I-KP
a I-KP
dispute I-KP
with I-KP
a I-KP
public I-KP
authority I-KP
, I-KP
but I-KP
in I-KP
a I-KP
dispute I-KP
with I-KP
another I-KP
citizen I-KP
or I-KP
company I-KP
. O

So O
, O
in O
CIA O
Security O
v O
Signalson O
and O
Securitel O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
business O
called O
CIA O
Security O
could O
defend O
itself O
from O
allegations O
by O
competitors O
that O
it O
had O
not O
complied O
with O
a O
Belgian O
decree O
from O
1991 O
about O
alarm O
systems O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
it O
had O
not O
been O
notified O
to O
the O
Commission O
as O
a O
Directive O
required O
. O

Third O
, O
if O
a O
Directive O
gives O
expression O
to O
a O
`` O
general O
principle O
'' O
of O
EU O
law O
, O
it O
can O
be O
invoked O
between O
private O
non O
state O
parties O
before O
its O
deadline O
for O
implementation O
. O

This O
follows O
from O
K O
c O
kdeveci O
v O
Swedex O
GmbH O
& O
Co O
KG O
where O
the O
German O
Civil O
Code O
622 O
stated O
that O
the O
years O
people O
worked O
under O
the O
age O
of O
25 O
would O
not O
count O
towards O
the O
increasing O
statutory O
notice O
before O
dismissal O
. O

Ms O
K O
c O
kdeveci O
worked O
for O
10 B-KP
years I-KP
, O
from O
age O
18 O
to O
28 O
, O
for O
Swedex O
GmbH O
& O
Co O
KG O
before O
her O
dismissal O
. O

She O
claimed O
that O
the O
law O
not O
counting O
her O
years O
under O
age O
25 O
was O
unlawful O
age O
discrimination O
under O
the O
Employment O
Equality O
Framework O
Directive O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
the O
Directive O
could O
be O
relied O
on O
by O
her O
because O
equality O
was O
also O
a O
general O
principle O
of O
EU O
law O
. O

Third O
, O
if O
the O
defendant O
is O
an O
emanation O
of O
the O
state O
, O
even O
if O
not O
central O
government O
, O
it O
can O
still O
be O
bound O
by O
Directives O
. O

In O
Foster O
v O
British O
Gas O
plc O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Mrs O
Foster O
was O
entitled O
to O
bring O
a O
sex O
discrimination O
claim O
against O
her O
employer O
, O
British B-KP
Gas I-KP
plc I-KP
, O
which O
made O
women B-KP
retire I-KP
at I-KP
age I-KP
60 I-KP
and I-KP
men I-KP
at I-KP
65 I-KP
, O
if O
( O
1 O
) O
pursuant O
to O
a O
state O
measure O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
it O
provided O
a O
public O
service O
, O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
had O
special O
powers O
. O

This O
could O
also O
be O
true O
if O
the O
enterprise O
is O
privatised O
, O
as O
it O
was O
held O
with O
a O
water O
company O
that O
was O
responsible O
for O
basic O
water O
provision O
. O

Fourth O
, O
national B-KP
courts I-KP
have O
a O
duty O
to O
interpret O
domestic O
law O
`` O
as O
far O
as O
possible O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
wording O
and O
purpose O
of O
the O
directive O
'' O
. O

Textbooks O
( O
though O
not O
the O
Court O
itself O
) O
often O
called O
this O
`` O
indirect O
effect O
'' O
. O

In O
Marleasing O
SA O
v O
La O
Comercial O
SA O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
Spanish O
Court O
had O
to O
interpret O
its O
general O
Civil O
Code O
provisions O
, O
on O
contracts O
lacking O
cause O
or O
defrauding O
creditors O
, O
to O
conform O
with O
the O
First O
Company O
Law O
Directive O
article O
11 O
, O
that O
required O
incorporations B-KP
would I-KP
only I-KP
be I-KP
nullified I-KP
for I-KP
a I-KP
fixed I-KP
list I-KP
of I-KP
reasons I-KP
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
quickly O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
duty O
of O
interpretation O
can O
not O
contradict O
plain O
words O
in O
a O
national O
statute O
. O

But O
, O
fifth O
, O
if O
a O
member O
state O
has O
failed O
to O
implement O
a O
Directive O
, O
a O
citizen O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
bring O
claims O
against O
other O
non O
state O
parties O
, O
but O
can O
sue O
the O
member O
state O
itself O
for O
failure O
to O
implement O
the O
law O
. O

So O
, O
in O
Francovich O
v O
Italy O
, O
the O
Italian O
government O
had O
failed B-KP
to B-KP
set I-KP
up I-KP
an I-KP
insurance I-KP
fund I-KP
for I-KP
employees I-KP
to I-KP
claim I-KP
unpaid I-KP
wages I-KP
if I-KP
their I-KP
employers I-KP
had I-KP
gone I-KP
insolvent I-KP
, I-KP
as I-KP
the I-KP
Insolvency I-KP
Protection I-KP
Directive I-KP
required I-KP
. O

Francovich O
, O
the O
former O
employee O
of O
a O
bankrupt O
Venetian O
firm O
, O
was O
therefore O
allowed O
to O
claim O
6 B-KP
million I-KP
Lira I-KP
from O
the O
Italian O
government O
in O
damages O
for O
his O
loss O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
if O
a O
Directive O
would O
confer O
identifiable O
rights O
on O
individuals O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
causal O
link O
between O
a O
member O
state O
's O
violation O
of O
EU O
and O
a O
claimant O
's O
loss O
, O
damages O
must O
be O
paid O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
the O
incompatible O
law O
is O
an O
Act O
of O
Parliament O
is O
no O
defence O
. O

The O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
are O
rules O
of O
law O
which O
have O
been O
developed O
by O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
that O
constitute O
unwritten O
rules O
which O
are O
not O
expressly O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
treaties O
but O
which O
affect O
how O
European O
Union O
law O
is O
interpreted O
and O
applies O
. O

In O
formulating O
these O
principles O
, O
the O
courts O
have O
drawn O
on O
a O
variety O
of O
sources O
, O
including O
: O
public O
international O
law O
and O
legal O
doctrines O
and O
principles O
present O
in O
the O
legal O
systems O
of O
European O
Union O
member O
states O
and O
in O
the O
jurisprudence O
of O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Human O
Rights O
. O

Accepted O
general O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
Law O
include O
fundamental B-KP
rights I-KP
( I-KP

human I-KP
rights I-KP
) I-KP
, I-KP
proportionality I-KP
, I-KP
legal I-KP
certainty I-KP
, I-KP
equality I-KP
before I-KP
the I-KP
law I-KP
and I-KP
subsidiarity I-KP
. O

Proportionality O
is O
recognised O
one O
of O
the O
general O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
by O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
since B-KP
the I-KP
1950s I-KP
. O

According O
to O
the O
general O
principle O
of O
proportionality O
the B-KP
lawfulness I-KP
of I-KP
an I-KP
action I-KP
depends I-KP
on I-KP
whether I-KP
it I-KP
was I-KP
appropriate I-KP
and I-KP
necessary I-KP
to I-KP
achieve I-KP
the I-KP
objectives I-KP
legitimately I-KP
pursued I-KP
. O

When O
there O
is O
a O
choice O
between O
several O
appropriate O
measures O
the B-KP
least I-KP
onerous I-KP
must I-KP
be I-KP
adopted I-KP
, O
and O
any O
disadvantage O
caused O
must O
not O
be O
disproportionate O
to O
the O
aims O
pursued O
. O

The O
principle O
of O
proportionality O
is O
also O
recognised O
in B-KP
Article B-KP
5 I-KP
of O
the O
EC O
Treaty O
, O
stating O
that O
`` O
any O
action O
by O

shall O
not O
go O
beyond O
what O
is O
necessary O
to O
achieve O
the O
objectives O
of O
this O
Treaty O
'' O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
legal O
certainty O
is O
recognised O
one O
of O
the O
general O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
by O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
since B-KP
the I-KP
1960s I-KP
. O

It O
is O
an O
important O
general O
principle O
of O
international B-KP
law I-KP
and I-KP
public I-KP
law I-KP
, O
which O
predates O
European O
Union O
law O
. O

As O
a O
general O
principle O
in O
European O
Union O
law O
it O
means O
that O
the O
law O
must O
be O
certain O
, O
in O
that O
it O
is O
clear O
and O
precise O
, O
and O
its O
legal O
implications O
foreseeable O
, O
specially O
when O
applied O
to O
financial O
obligations O
. O

The O
adoption O
of O
laws O
which O
will O
have O
legal O
effect O
in O
the O
European O
Union O
must O
have O
a B-KP
proper I-KP
legal I-KP
basis I-KP
. O

Legislation O
in O
member O
states O
which O
implements O
European O
Union O
law O
must O
be O
worded O
so O
that O
it O
is O
clearly O
understandable O
by O
those O
who O
are O
subject O
to O
the O
law O
. O

In O
European O
Union O
law O
the O
general O
principle O
of O
legal O
certainty O
prohibits O
Ex O
post O
facto O
laws O
, O
i.e O
. O

laws O
should O
not O
take O
effect O
before O
they O
are O
published O
. O

The O
doctrine O
of O
legitimate O
expectation O
, O
which O
has O
its O
roots O
in O
the B-KP
principles I-KP
of I-KP
legal I-KP
certainty I-KP
and I-KP
good I-KP
faith I-KP
, O
is O
also O
a O
central O
element O
of O
the O
general O
principle O
of O
legal O
certainty O
in O
European O
Union O
law O
. O

The O
legitimate O
expectation O
doctrine O
holds O
that O
and O
that O
`` O
those O
who O
act O
in O
good O
faith O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
law O
as O
it O

or O
seems O
to O
be O
should O
not O
be O
frustrated O
in O
their O
expectations O
'' O
. O

Fundamental O
rights O
, O
as O
in O
human O
rights O
, O
were O
first O
recognised O
by O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
in O
the O
late O
60s O
and O
fundamental O
rights O
are O
now O
regarded O
as O
integral O
part O
of O
the O
general O
principles O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
. O

As O
such O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
is O
bound O
to O
draw O
inspiration O
from B-KP
the B-KP
constitutional I-KP
traditions I-KP
common I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
member I-KP
states I-KP
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
can O
not O
uphold O
measures O
which O
are O
incompatible O
with O
fundamental B-KP
rights I-KP
recognised I-KP
and I-KP
protected I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
constitutions I-KP
of I-KP
member I-KP
states I-KP
. O

The O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
also O
found O
that O
`` O

of O

they O

signatories O
, O
can O
supply O
guidelines O
which O

be O
followed O
within O
the O
framework O
of O

law O
. O
'' O

None B-KP
of O
the O
original O
treaties O
establishing O
the O
European O

mention O
protection O
for O

It O
was O
not O
envisaged O
for O
European O
Union O
measures O
, O
that O
is O
legislative O
and O
administrative O
actions O
by O
European O
Union O
institutions O
, O
to O
be O
subject O
to O
human O
rights O
. O

At O
the O
time O
the O
only O
concern O
was O
that O
member B-KP
states I-KP
should O
be O
prevented O
from O
violating O
human O
rights O
, O
hence O
the O
establishment O
of O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Convention I-KP
on I-KP
Human I-KP
Rights I-KP
in I-KP
1950 B-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP

the B-KP
European B-KP

of I-KP
Human I-KP
Rights I-KP
. I-KP

The O
European O
Court O
of O
Justice O
recognised O
fundamental O
rights O
as O
general O
principle O
of O
European O
Union O
law O
as O
the O
need O
to O
ensure O
that O
European O
Union O
measures O
are O
compatible O
with O
the O
human O
rights O
enshrined O
in O
member O
states O
' O
constitution O
became O
ever O
more O
apparent O
. O

In O
1999 B-KP
the O
European O
Council O
set O
up O
a O
body O
tasked O
with O
drafting O
a O
European O
Charter O
of O
Human O
Rights O
, O
which O
could O
form O
the O
constitutional O
basis O
for O
the O
European O
Union O
and O
as O
such O
tailored O
specifically O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
European O
Union O
and O
its O
institutions O
. O

The O
Charter O
of O
Fundamental O
Rights O
of O
the O
European O
Union O
draws O
a O
list O
of O
fundamental O
rights O
from O
the O
European O
Convention O
on O
Human O
Rights O
and O
Fundamental O
Freedoms O
, O
the O
Declaration O
on O
Fundamental O
Rights O
produced O
by O
the O
European O
Parliament O
in O
1989 O
and O
European O
Union O
Treaties O
. O

The O
2007 B-KP
Lisbon O
Treaty O
explicitly O
recognised O
fundamental O
rights O
by O
providing O
in O
Article O
6 O
( O
1 O
) O
that O
`` O
The O

Therefore O
, O
the B-KP
Charter I-KP
of I-KP
Fundamental I-KP

the I-KP

has O

EU O

in O
1951 B-KP
following O
the O

The O

aimed O
to O
prevent O
Germany O

in O
the O

Article O

of O
the O

This O
was O
the O
first O
time O
that O
competition O

were O
included O
in O
a O
plurilateral O

the O

In O

which O
established O
the O

The O
Treaty O

The O
two O
central O
provisions O
on O
EU O
competition O

were O
established O
in O
article O

prohibiting O
the O

The O

also O
established O

, O
such O
as O

Articles B-KP

provide O
that O

Article O
107 O
lays O
down O
a O
general O
rule O
that O

While O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
`` O
social O
market O
economy O
'' O
was O
only O
introduced O
into O
EU O
law O
in O
2007 B-KP
, O
free O
movement O
and O
trade O
were O
central O
to O
European O
development O
since B-KP
the I-KP
Treaty I-KP
of I-KP
Rome I-KP
1957 I-KP
. O

According O
to O
the O
standard O
theory O
of O
comparative O
advantage O
, O
two O
countries O
can O
both O
benefit O
from O
trade O
even O
if O
one O
of O
them O
has O
a O
less O
productive O
economy O
in O
all O
respects O
. O

Like O
in O
other O
regional O
organisations O
such O
as O
the O
North O
American O
Free O
Trade O
Association O
, O
or O
the O
World O
Trade O
Organisation O
, O
breaking O
down O
barriers O
to O
trade O
, O
and O
enhancing O
free O
movement O
of O
goods O
, O
services O
, O
labour O
and O
capital O
, O
is O
meant O
to O
reduce B-KP
consumer I-KP
prices I-KP
. O

It O
was O
originally O
theorised O
that O
a O
free O
trade O
area O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
give O
way O
to O
a O
customs O
union O
, O
which O
led O
to O
a O
common O
market O
, O
then O
monetary O
union O
, O
then O
union O
of O
monetary O
and O
fiscal O
policy O
, O
political O
and O
eventually O
a O
full O
union O
characteristic O
of O
a O
federal O
state O
. O

In O
Europe O
, O
however O
, O
those O
stages O
were O
considerably O
mixed O
, O
and O
it O
remains O
unclear O
whether O
the O
`` O
endgame O
'' O
should O
be O
the O
same O
as O
a O
state O
, O
traditionally O
understood O
. O

In O
practice O
free O
trade O
, O
without O
standards O
to O
ensure O
fair O
trade O
, O
can O
benefit O
some O
people O
and O
groups O
within O
countries O
( O
particularly O
big O
business O
) O
much O
more O
than O
others O
, O
but O
will O
burden O
people O
who O
lack O
bargaining O
power O
in O
an O
expanding O
market O
, O
particularly O
workers O
, O
consumers O
, O
small O
business O
, O
developing O
industries O
, O
and O
communities O
. O

The O
Treaty O
on O
the O
Functioning O
of O
the O
European O
Union O
articles O
28 O
to O
37 O
establish O
the O
principle O
of O
free O
movement O
of O
goods O
in O
the O
EU O
, O
while O
articles O
45 O
to O
66 O
require O
free O
movement O
of O
persons O
, O
services O
and O
capital O
. O

These O
so O
called O
`` O
four O
freedoms O
'' O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
inhibited O
by O
physical O
barriers O
( O
e.g O
. O

customs O
) O
, O
technical O
barriers O
( O
e.g O
. O

differing O
laws O
on O
safety O
, O
consumer O
or O
environmental O
standards O
) O
and O
fiscal O
barriers O
( O
e.g O
. O

different O
Value O
Added O
Tax O
rates O
) O
. O

The O
tension O
in O
the O
law O
is O
that O
the O
free O
movement O
and O
trade O
is O
not O
supposed O
to O
spill O
over O
into O
a O
licence O
for O
unrestricted O
commercial O
profit O
. O

The O
Treaties O
limit O
free B-KP
trade I-KP
, O
to O
prioritise O
other O
values O
such O
as O
public O
health O
, O
consumer O
protection O
, O
labour O
rights O
, O
fair O
competition O
, O
and O
environmental O
improvement O
. O

Increasingly O
the B-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
has O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
the O
specific O
goals O
of O
free O
trade O
are O
underpinned O
by O
the O
general O
aims O
of O
the O
treaty O
for O
improvement O
of O
people O
's O
well O
being O
. O

Free O
movement O
of O
goods O
within O
the O
European O
Union O
is O
achieved O
by O
a B-KP
customs I-KP
union I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
principle I-KP
of I-KP
non I-KP
discrimination I-KP
. O

The O
EU O
manages O
imports O
from O
non O
member O
states O
, O
duties O
between O
member O
states O
are O
prohibited O
, O
and O
imports O
circulate O
freely O
. O

In O
addition O
under O
the O
Treaty O
on O
the O
Functioning O
of O
the O
European O
Union O
article O
34 O
, O
Quantitative O
restrictions O
on O
imports O
and O
all O
measures O
having O
equivalent O
effect O
shall O
be O
prohibited O
between O
Member O
States O
. O

In O
Procureur O
du O
Roi O
v O
Dassonville O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
this O
rule O
meant O
all O
`` O
trading O
rules O
'' O
that O
are O
`` O
enacted O
by O
Member O
States O
'' O
which O
could O
hinder O
trade O
`` O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
, O
actually O
or O
potentially O
'' O
would O
be O
caught O
by O
article O
34 O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
a O
Belgian O
law O
requiring O
Scotch O
whisky O
imports O
to O
have O
a O
certificate O
of O
origin O
was O
unlikely O
to O
be O
lawful O
. O

It O
discriminated O
against O
parallel B-KP
importers I-KP
like I-KP
Mr I-KP
Dassonville I-KP
, O
who O
could O
not O
get O
certificates O
from O
authorities O
in O
France O
, O
where O
they O
bought O
the O
Scotch O
. O

This O
`` O
wide O
test O
'' O
, O
to O
determine O
what O
could O
potentially O
be O
an O
unlawful O
restriction O
on O
trade O
, O
applies O
equally O
to O
actions O
by O
quasi O
government O
bodies O
, O
such O
as O
the O
former O
`` O
Buy O
Irish O
'' O
company O
that O
had O
government O
appointees O
. O

It O
also O
means O
states O
can O
be O
responsible O
for O
private B-KP
actors I-KP
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
Commission B-KP
v I-KP
France I-KP
French I-KP
farmer O
vigilantes O
were O
continually O
sabotaging O
shipments O
of O
Spanish O
strawberries O
, O
and O
even O
Belgian O
tomato O
imports O
. O

France O
was O
liable O
for O
these O
hindrances O
to O
trade O
because O
the O
authorities O
manifestly O
and O
persistently O
abstained O
' O
from O
preventing O
the O
sabotage O
. O

Generally O
speaking O
, O
if O
a O
member O
state O
has O
laws O
or O
practices O
that O
directly O
discriminate O
against O
imports O
( O
or O
exports O
under O
TFEU O
article O
35 O
) O
then O
it O
must O
be O
justified O
under O
article O
36 O
. O

The O
justifications O
include O
public O
morality O
, O
policy O
or O
security O
, O
`` O
protection O
of O
health O
and O
life O
of O
humans O
, O
animals O
or O
plants O
'' O
, O
`` O
national O
treasures O
'' O
of O
`` O
artistic O
, O
historic O
or O
archaeological O
value O
'' O
and O
`` O
industrial O
and O
commercial O
property O
. O
'' O

In O
addition O
, O
although O
not O
clearly O
listed O
, O
environmental O
protection O
can O
justify O
restrictions O
on O
trade O
as O
an O
overriding O
requirement O
derived O
from O
TFEU O
article O
11 O
. O

More O
generally O
, O
it O
has O
been O
increasingly O
acknowledged O
that O
fundamental O
human O
rights O
should O
take O
priority O
over O
all O
trade O
rules O
. O

So O
, O
in O
Schmidberger O
v O
Austria O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Austria O
did O
not O
infringe O
article O
34 O
by O
failing O
to O
ban O
a B-KP
protest I-KP
that I-KP
blocked I-KP
heavy I-KP
traffic I-KP
passing O
over O
the O
A13 O
, O
Brenner O
Autobahn O
, O
en O
route O
to O
Italy O
. O

Although O
many O
companies O
, O
including O
Mr O
Schmidberger O
's O
German O
undertaking O
, O
were O
prevented O
from O
trading O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
reasoned O
that O
freedom O
of O
association O
is O
one O
of O
the O
fundamental O
pillars O
of O
a O
democratic O
society O
, O
against O
which O
the O
free O
movement O
of O
goods O
had O
to O
be O
balanced O
, O
and O
was O
probably O
subordinate O
. O

If O
a O
member O
state O
does O
appeal O
to O
the O
article O
36 O
justification O
, O
the O
measures O
it O
takes O
have O
to O
be O
applied O
proportionately O
. O

This O
means O
the O
rule O
must O
be O
pursue O
a O
legitimate O
aim O
and O
( O
1 O
) O
be O
suitable O
to O
achieve O
the O
aim O
, O
( O
2 O
) O
be O
necessary O
, O
so O
that O
a O
less O
restrictive O
measure O
could O
not O
achieve O
the O
same O
result O
, O
and O
( O
3 O
) O
be O
reasonable O
in O
balancing O
the O
interests O
of O
free O
trade O
with O
interests O
in O
article O
36 O
. O

Often O
rules O
apply O
to O
all O
goods O
neutrally O
, O
but O
may O
have O
a O
greater O
practical O
effect O
on O
imports O
than O
domestic O
products O
. O

For O
such O
`` O
indirect O
'' O
discriminatory O
( O
or O
`` O
indistinctly O
applicable O
'' O
) O
measures O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
has O
developed O
more O
justifications O
: O
either O
those O
in O
article O
36 O
, O
or O
additional O
`` O
mandatory O
'' O
or O
`` O
overriding O
'' O
requirements O
such O
as O
consumer O
protection O
, O
improving O
labour O
standards O
, O
protecting O
the O
environment O
, O
press O
diversity O
, O
fairness O
in O

and O
more O

Justice O
found O
that O
a O
German O
law O
requiring O
all O
spirits O
and O
liqueurs O
( O
not O
just O
imported O
ones O
) O
to O
have O
a O
minimum O
alcohol O
content O
of O
25 B-KP
per I-KP
cent I-KP
was O
contrary O
to O
TFEU O
article O
34 O
, O
because O
it O
had O
a O
greater O
negative O
effect O
on O
imports O
. O

German O
liqueurs O
were O
over O
25 O
per O
cent O
alcohol O
, O
but O
Cassis O

Dijon O
, O
which O
Rewe O

wished O
to O
import O
from O
France B-KP
, O
only O
had O
15 O
to O
20 O
per O
cent O
alcohol O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
rejected O
the O
German O
government O
's O
arguments O
that O
the O
measure O
proportionately O
protected O
public O
health O
under O
TFEU O
article O
36 O
, O
because O
stronger O
beverages O
were O
available O
and O
adequate O
labelling O
would O
be O
enough O
for O
consumers O
to O
understand O
what O
they O
bought O
. O

This O
rule O
primarily O
applies O
to O
requirements O
about O
a O
product O
's O
content O
or O
packaging O
. O

In O
Walter O
Rau O
Lebensmittelwerke O
v O
De O
Smedt O
PVBA O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
found O
that O
a O
Belgian O
law O
requiring O
all O
margarine O
to O
be O
in O
cube O
shaped O
packages O
infringed O
article O
34 O
, O
and O
was O
not O
justified O
by O
the O
pursuit O
of O
consumer O
protection O
. O

The O
argument O
that O
Belgians O
would O
believe O
it O
was O
butter O
if O
it O
was O
not O
cube O
shaped O
was O
disproportionate O
: O
it O
would O
`` O
considerably O
exceed O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
object O
in O
view O
'' O
and O
labelling O
would O
protect O
consumers O
`` O
just O
as O
effectively O
'' O
. O

In O
a O
2003 B-KP
case O
, O
Commission O
v O
Italy O
Italian O
law O
required O
that O
cocoa O
products O
that O
included O
other O
vegetable O
fats O
could O
not O
be O
labelled O
as O
`` O
chocolate O
'' O
. O

It O
had O
to O
be O
`` O
chocolate O
substitute O
'' O
. O

All O
Italian O
chocolate O
was O
made O
from O
cocoa B-KP
butter I-KP
alone O
, O
but O
British O
, O
Danish O
and O
Irish O
manufacturers O
used O
other O
vegetable O
fats O
. O

They O
claimed O
the O
law O
infringed O
article O
34 O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
low O
content O
of O
vegetable O
fat O
did O
not O
justify O
a O
`` O
chocolate O
substitute O
'' O
label O
. O

This O
was O
derogatory O
in O
the O
consumers O
' O
eyes O
. O

A O
neutral O
and O
objective O
statement O
was O
enough O
to O
protect O
consumers O
. O

If O
member O
states O
place O
considerable O
obstacles O
on O
the O
use O
of O
a O
product O
, O
this O
can O
also O
infringe O
article O
34 O
. O

So O
, O
in O
a O
2009 O
case O
, O
Commission O
v O
Italy O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
an O
Italian O
law O
prohibiting O
motorcycles B-KP
or I-KP
mopeds I-KP
pulling I-KP
trailers I-KP
infringed O
article O
34 O
. O

Again O
, O
the O
law O
applied O
neutrally O
to O
everyone O
, O
but O
disproportionately O
affected O
importers O
, O
because O
Italian O
companies O
did O
not O
make O
trailers O
. O

This O
was O
not O
a O
product O
requirement O
, O
but O
the O
Court O
reasoned O
that O
the O
prohibition O
would O
deter O
people O
from O
buying O
it O
: O
it O
would O
have O
`` O
a O
considerable O
influence O
on O
the O
behaviour O
of O
consumers O
'' O
that O
`` O
affects O
the O
access O
of O
that O
product O
to O
the O
market O
'' O
. O

It O
would O
require O
justification O
under O
article O
36 O
, O
or O
as O
a O
mandatory O
requirement O
. O

In O
contrast O
to O
product O
requirements O
or O
other O
laws O
that O
hinder O
market O
access O
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
developed O
a O
presumption O
that O
`` O
selling O
arrangements O
'' O
would O
be O
presumed O
to O
not O
fall O
into O
TFEU O
article O
34 O
, O
if O
they O
applied O
equally O
to O
all O
sellers O
, O
and O
affected O
them O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
in O
fact O
. O

In O
Keck B-KP
and I-KP
Mithouard I-KP
two O
importers O
claimed O
that O
their O
prosecution O
under O
a O
French O
competition O
law O
, O
which O
prevented O
them O
selling O
Picon O
beer O
under O
wholesale O
price O
, O
was O
unlawful O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
the O
law O
was O
to O
prevent B-KP
cut I-KP
throat I-KP
competition I-KP
, O
not O
to O
hinder O
trade O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
, O
as O
`` O
in O
law O
and O
in O
fact O
'' O
it O
was O
an O
equally O
applicable O
`` O
selling O

'' O
( O
not O
something O
that O
alters O
a O
product O
's O
content O
) O
it O
was O
outside O
the O
scope O
of O
article O
34 O
, O
and O
so O
did O
not O
need O
to O
be O
justified O
. O

Selling O
arrangements O
can O
be O
held O
to O
have O
an O
unequal O
effect O
`` O
in O
fact O
'' O
particularly O
where O
traders O
from O
another O
member O
state O
are O
seeking O
to O
break O
into O
the O
market O
, O
but O
there O
are O
restrictions O
on O
advertising O
and O
marketing O
. O

In O
Konsumentombudsmannen B-KP
v I-KP
De I-KP
Agostini I-KP
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
reviewed O
Swedish O
bans O
on O
advertising O
to O
children O
under O
age O
12 O
, O
and O
misleading O
commercials O
for O
skin O

While O
the O
bans O
have O
remained O
( O
justifiable O
under O
article O
36 O
or O
as O
a O
mandatory O
requirement O
) O
the O
Court O
emphasised O
that O
complete O
marketing O
bans O
could O
be O
disproportionate O
if O
advertising O
were O
`` O
the O
only O

of O

. O

In O
Konsumentombudsmannen O
v O
Gourmet O
AB O
the O
Court O
suggested O
that O
a O
total O
ban O
for O
advertising O
alcohol O
on O
the O
radio O
, O
TV O
and O
in O
magazines O
could O
fall O
within O
article O
34 O
where O
advertising O
was O
the O
only O
way O
for O

to O
overcome O
consumers O
' O
`` O

but O
again O
the O
national O
courts O
would O
decide O
whether O
it O
was O
justified O
under O
article O
36 O
to O
protect O

Under O
the B-KP
Unfair I-KP
Commercial I-KP
Practices I-KP
Directive I-KP
, O
the O
EU O
harmonised O
restrictions O
on O

on O

, O
to O
forbid O
conduct O
that O
distorts O
average O

behaviour O
, O
is O
misleading O
or O
aggressive O
, O
and O
sets O
out O
a O
list O
of O
examples O
that O
count O
as O
unfair O
. O

Increasingly O
, O
states O
have O
to O
give O
mutual O
recognition O
to O
each O
other O
's O
standards O
of O
regulation O
, O
while O
the O
EU O
has O
attempted O
to O
harmonise O
minimum O
ideals O
of O

. O

The O
attempt O
to O
raise O
standards O
is O
hoped O
to O
avoid O
a O
regulatory O
`` O

the O
bottom O
'' O
, O
while O
allowing O
consumers O
access O

Since B-KP
its I-KP
foundation I-KP
, O
the O
Treaties O
sought O
to B-KP
enable I-KP
people B-KP
to I-KP
pursue I-KP
their I-KP
life I-KP
goals I-KP
in I-KP
any I-KP
country I-KP
through I-KP
free I-KP
movement I-KP
. O

Reflecting O
the O
economic O
nature O
of O
the O
project O
, O
the B-KP
European I-KP
Community I-KP
originally O
focused O
upon O
free O
movement O
of O
workers O
: O
as O
a O
`` O
factor O
of O
production O
'' O
. O

However O
, O
from O
the O
1970s O
, O
this O
focus O
shifted O
towards O
developing O
a O
more O
`` O
social O
'' O
Europe O
. O

Free O
movement O
was O
increasingly O
based O
on O
`` O
citizenship B-KP
'' O
, O
so O
that O
people O
had O
rights O
to O
empower O
them O
to O
become O
economically O
and O
socially O
active O
, O
rather O
than O
economic O
activity O
being O
a O
precondition O
for O
rights O
. O

This O
means O
the O
basic O
`` O
worker O
'' O
rights O
in O
TFEU O
article O
45 O
function O
as O
a O
specific O
expression O
of O
the O
general O
rights O
of O
citizens O
in O
TFEU O
articles O
18 O
to O
21 O
. O

According O
to O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
, O
a O
`` O
worker O
'' O
is O
anybody O
who O
is O
economically O
active O
, O
which O
includes O
everyone O
in O
an O
employment O
relationship O
, O
`` O
under O
the O

'' O
for O
`` O

'' O
. O

A O

however O
, O
need O
not O
be O
paid O
in O
money O
for O
someone O
to O
be O
protected O
as O
a O
worker O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Steymann B-KP
v I-KP
Staatssecretaris I-KP
van I-KP
Justitie I-KP
, O
a O
German O
man O
claimed O
the O
right O
to O

in O
the O
Netherlands O
, O
while O
he O
volunteered O
plumbing O
and O
household O
duties O
in O
the O
Bhagwan O
community O
, O
which O
provided O
for O
everyone O
's O
material O
needs O
irrespective O
of O
their O
contributions O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Mr O

was O
entitled O
to B-KP
stay B-KP
, I-KP

the I-KP
work I-KP

Having O
`` O
worker O
'' O
status O
means O
protection O
against O
all O
forms O
of O
discrimination O
by O
governments O
, O
and O
employers O
, O
in O
access O
to O
employment O

In O

a O

The O

In O
Commission B-KP

Austria I-KP
the I-KP
Court I-KP
held O
that O
Austria O

In O
Gebhard O
v O
Consiglio O
dell O
Ordine O
degli O
Avvocati O
e O
Procuratori O
di O
Milano O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
to O
be O
`` O

means O
to O

`` I-KP

a I-KP
stable I-KP

continuous I-KP

while O
providing O
`` O

'' O
meant O
pursuing O
activity O
more O
`` O

a O

basis O
'' O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
a O
lawyer O
from O
Stuttgart O
, O
who O
had O
set O
up O
chambers O
in O
Milan O
and O
was O
censured O
by O
the O
Milan O

for O
not O

was O
entitled O

bring O
a O
claim O
under O

freedom O
, O
rather O
than O

However O
, O
the O
requirements O
to O
be O
registered O
in O
Milan O
before O
being O
able O
to O

would O
be O
allowed O
if B-KP
they I-KP

All O

particularly O
the O

have O
a O
right O
to O

The O
Court O
of O

has O
held O
that O
both O
a O
member O
state O

and O
a O
private O
party O
can O
hinder O

so O
article O

has O
both O
`` O

`` O

effect O

In O
Reyners B-KP
v I-KP
Belgium I-KP
the I-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
held O
that O
a O
refusal O
to O
admit O
a O

to O
the O
Belgian O
bar O
because O
he O
lacked O
Belgian O
nationality O
was O
unjustified O

TFEU B-KP
article B-KP
49 I-KP
says O
states O
are O
exempt O
from O
infringing O
others O
' O
freedom O
of O

when O
they O
exercise O
`` O
official O

, O
but O
this O
did O
an O
advocate O
's O
work O
( O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
court O
's O
) O
was O
not O
official O
. O

By O
contrast O
in O
Commission B-KP
v I-KP
Italy I-KP
the I-KP
Court I-KP
of I-KP
Justice I-KP
held O
that O
a O
requirement O
for O
lawyers O
in O
Italy O
to O
comply O
with O
maximum O
tariffs O
unless O
there O
was O
an O
agreement O
with O
a O

was O
not O
a O
restriction O
. O

The O
Grand O
Chamber O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
the O
Commission O
had O
not O
proven O
that O
this O
had O
any O
object O
or O
effect O
of O
limiting O
practitioners O
from O
entering O
the O
market O
. O

Therefore O
, O
there O
was O
no O
prima O

infringement O
freedom O
of O

that O
needed O
to O
be O
justified O

In O
2006 B-KP
, O
a O
toxic O
waste O
spill O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
C O
te O

, O
from O
a O
European O
ship O
, O
prompted O
the O
Commission O
to O
look O
into O
legislation O
against O
toxic B-KP
waste I-KP
. O

Environment O
Commissioner O
Stavros O
Dimas O
stated O
that O
`` O
Such O
highly O
toxic O

should O
never O
have O
left O
the O
European O
Union O

With O
countries O
such O
as O
Spain O
not O
even O
having O
a O
crime O
against O

toxic I-KP
waste I-KP
, O
Franco O
Frattini O
, O
the O
Justice O
, O
Freedom O

Security O
Commissioner O
, O
proposed O
with O
Dimas O
to O
create O
criminal O
sentences O
for O
`` O
ecological O
crimes O
'' O
. O

The O
competence O
for O
the O
Union O
to O
do O
this O
was O
contested O
in O
2005 B-KP
at O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
resulting O
in O
a O
victory O
for O
the O
Commission O
. O

That O
ruling O
set O
a O
precedent O
that O
the O
Commission O
, O
on O
a O
supranational O
basis O
, O
may O
legislate O
in O
criminal O
law O
something O
never O
done O
before O
. O

So O
far O
, O
the O
only O
other O
proposal O
has O
been O
the O
draft O
intellectual O
property O
rights O
directive O
. O

Motions O
were O
tabled O
in O
the O
European O
Parliament O
against O
that O
legislation O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
criminal O
law O
should O
not O
be O
an O
EU O
competence O
, O
but O
was O
rejected O
at O
vote O
. O

However O
, O
in O
October B-KP
2007 B-KP
, O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
ruled O
that O
the O
Commission O
could O
not O
propose O
what O
the O
criminal O
sanctions O
could O
be O
, O
only O
that O
there O
must O

The O
`` O
freedom O
to O
provide O

'' O
under O
TFEU O
article O
56 O
applies O
to B-KP
people B-KP
who I-KP
give I-KP
services I-KP
`` I-KP
for I-KP
remuneration I-KP
'' I-KP
, I-KP
especially I-KP
commercial I-KP
or I-KP
professional I-KP
activity I-KP
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
Van O
Binsbergen O
v O
Bestuur O
van O
de O
Bedrijfvereniging O
voor O
de O
Metaalnijverheid O
a O
Dutch O
lawyer O
moved O
to O
Belgium O
while O
advising O
a O
client O
in O
a O
social O
security O
case O
, O
and O
was O
told O
he O
could O
not O
continue O
because B-KP
Dutch B-KP
law I-KP
said I-KP
only I-KP
people I-KP
established I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
Netherlands I-KP
could I-KP
give I-KP
legal I-KP
advice I-KP
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
the O
freedom O
to O
provide O
services O
applied O
, O
it O
was O
directly O
effective O
, O
and O
the O
rule O
was O
probably O
unjustified O
: O
having O
an O
address O
in O
the O
member O
state O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
pursue O
the O
legitimate O
aim O
of O
good O
administration O
of O
justice O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
has O
held O
that O
secondary O
education O
falls O
outside O
the O
scope O
of O
article O
56 O
, O
because O
usually O
the O
state O
funds O
it O
, O
though O
higher O
education O
does O
not O
. O

Health O
care O
generally O
counts O
as O
a O
service O
. O

In O
Geraets O
Smits O
v O
Stichting O
Ziekenfonds O
Mrs O
Geraets O
Smits O
claimed O
she O
should O
be O
reimbursed O
by O
Dutch O
social O
insurance O
for O
costs O
of O
receiving O
treatment O
in O
Germany O
. O

The O
Dutch O
health O
authorities O
regarded O
the B-KP
treatment B-KP
unnecessary O
, O
so O
she O
argued O
this O
restricted O
the O
freedom O
( O
of O
the O
German O
health O
clinic O
) O
to O
provide O
services O
. O

Several O
governments O
submitted O
that O
hospital O
services O
should O
not O
be O
regarded O
as O
economic O
, O
and O
should O
not O
fall O
within O
article O
56 O
. O

But O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
health O
was O
a O
`` O
service O
'' O
even O
though O
the O
government O
( O
rather O
than O
the O
service O
recipient O
) O
paid O
for O
the O
service O
. O

National O
authorities O
could O
be O
justified O
in O
refusing O
to O
reimburse O
patients O
for O
medical O
services O
abroad O
if O
the O
health O
care O
received O
at O
home O
was O
without O
undue O
delay O
, O
and O
it O
followed O
`` O
international O
medical O
science O
'' O
on O
which O
treatments O
counted O
as O
normal O
and O
necessary O
. O

The O
Court O
requires O
that O
the O
individual O
circumstances O
of O
a O
patient O
justify O
waiting O
lists O
, O
and O
this O
is O
also O
true O
in O
the O
context O
of O
the O
UK O
's O
National O
Health O
Service O
. O

Aside O
from O
public O
services O
, O
another O
sensitive O
field O
of O
services O
are O
those O
classified O
as O
illegal O
. O

Josemans O
v O
Burgemeester O
van O
Maastricht O
held O
that O
the O
Netherlands O
' O
regulation O
of O

consumption O
, O
including O
the O
prohibitions O
by O
some O
municipalities O
on O

( O
but O
not O
Dutch O
nationals O
) O
going O
to O
coffee O
shops O
, O
fell O
outside O
article O
56 O
altogether O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
reasoned O
that O
narcotic B-KP
drugs I-KP
were O
controlled O
in O
all O
member O
states O
, O
and O
so O
this O
differed O
from O
other O
cases O
where O
prostitution O
or O
other O
quasi O
legal O
activity O
was O
subject O
to O
restriction O
. O

If O
an O
activity O
does O
fall O
within O
article O
56 O
, O
a O
restriction O
can O
be O
justified O
under O
article O
52 O
or O
overriding O
requirements O
developed O
by O
the O
Court O
of O

In O

to O

The O
Court O

held O

The O
Court O

held O
that O
the O
German O
constitutional O
value O
of O
human O
dignity O
, O
which O
underpinned O
the O
ban O

did O
count O
as O

In O

the O

and O
a O

for O

was O
justified O
to O
prevent O

and O
gambling O
where O
people O
's O
views O
were O
highly O

. O

The O
ban O
was O
proportionate O
as O
this O
was O
an O
appropriate O
and O
necessary O
way O
to O
tackle O
the O
serious O
problems O

In O
the O
Services O

a O

justifications O
were O
codified O

In O

the O

held O
in O

that O

company O
moving O
its O
seat O

without O
infringing O
TFEU O
article O

. O

This O
meant O
the B-KP
Daily I-KP
Mail I-KP
newspaper O

parent O
company O
could O
not O
evade O
tax O
by O
shifting O
its O

to O
the O
Netherlands O
without O
first O
settling O
its O
tax O
bills O
in O
the O
UK O
. O

The O
UK O
did O
not O
need O
to O
justify O
its O
action O
, O
as O
rules O
on O
company O
seats O
were O
not O
yet O
harmonised O
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
in O
Centros O
Ltd O
v O
Erhversus O
og O
Selkabssyrelsen O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
found O
that O
a O
UK O
limited O
company O
operating O
in O
Denmark O
could O
not O
be O
required O
to O
comply O
with O
Denmark O
's O
minimum O
share O
capital O
rules O
. O

UK O
law O
only O
required O
1 O
of O
capital O
to O
start O
a O
company O
, O
while O
Denmark O
's O
legislature O
took O
the O
view O
companies O
should O
only O
be O
started O
up O
if O
they O
had O
200,000 B-KP
Danish I-KP
krone I-KP
( O
around O
27,000 O
) O
to O
protect O
creditors O
if O
the O
company O
failed O
and O
went O
insolvent O
. O

The O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
Denmark B-KP
's I-KP
minimum I-KP
capital I-KP
law I-KP
infringed O
Centros O
Ltd O
's O
freedom O
of O
establishment O
and O
could O
not O
be O
justified O
, O
because O
a O
company O
in O
the O
UK O
could O
admittedly O
provide O
services O
in O
Denmark O
without O
being O
established O
there O
, O
and O
there O
were O
less O
restrictive O
means O
of O
achieving O
the O
aim O
of O
creditor O
protection O
. O

This O
approach O
was O
criticised O
as O
potentially O
opening O
the O
EU O
to O
unjustified O
regulatory O
competition O
, O
and O
a O
race O
to O
the O
bottom O
in O
standards O
, O
like O
in O
the O
US O
where O
the O
state O
Delaware O
attracts O
most O
companies O
and O
is O
often O
argued O
to O
have O
the O
worst O
standards O
of O
accountability O
of O
boards O
, O
and O
low O
corporate O
taxes O
as O
a O
result O
. O

Similarly O
in O
berseering O
BV O
v O
Nordic O
Construction O
GmbH O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
held O
that O
a O
German O
court O
could O
not O
deny O
a O
Dutch O
building O
company O
the O
right O
to O
enforce O
a O
contract O
in O
Germany O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
it O
was O
not O
validly O
incorporated O
in O
Germany O
. O

Although O
restrictions O
on O
freedom O
of O
establishment O
could O
be O
justified O
by O
creditor B-KP
protection I-KP
, I-KP
labour I-KP
rights I-KP
to I-KP
participate I-KP
in I-KP
work I-KP
, I-KP
or I-KP
the I-KP
public I-KP
interest I-KP
in I-KP
collecting I-KP
taxes I-KP
, O
denial O
of O
capacity O
went O
too O
far O
: O
it O
was O
an O
`` O
outright O
negation O
'' O
of O
the O
right O
of O
establishment O
. O

However O
, O
in O
Cartesio O
Oktat O
s O
Szolg O
ltat O
bt O
the O
Court O
of O
Justice O
affirmed O
again O
that O
because O
corporations O
are O
created O
by O
law O
, O
they O
are O
in O
principle O
subject O
to O
any O
rules O
for O
formation O
that O
a O
state O
of O
incorporation O
wishes O
to O
impose O
. O

This O
meant O
that O
the O
Hungarian O
authorities O
could O
prevent O
a O
company O
from O
shifting O
its O
central O
administration O
to O
Italy O
while O
it O
still O
operated O
and O
was O
incorporated O
in O
Hungary O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
court O
draws O
a O
distinction O
between O
the O
right O
of O
establishment O
for O
foreign O
companies O
( O
where O
restrictions O
must O
be O
justified O
) O
, O
and O
the O
right O
of O
the O
state O
to O
determine O
conditions O
for O

incorporated O

New O
research O
however O
, O
conducted O
by O
Leydimere O
Oliveira O
et O
al. O
, O
has O
shown O
that O
the O
more O
rainforest O
is O
logged O
in O
the O
Amazon O
, O
the O
less O
precipitation O
reaches O
the O
area O
and O
so O
the O
lower O
the O
yield O
per O

becomes O
. O

So O
despite O
the O
popular O
perception O
, O
there O
has O
been O
no O
economical O
advantage O
for O
Brazil O
from O
logging O
rainforest O
zones O
and O
converting O
these O
to O
pastoral O
fields O
. O

The O
needs O
of O
soy B-KP

have O
been O
used O
to O
justify O
many O
of O
the O
controversial O
transportation O
projects O
that O
are O
currently O
developing O
in O
the O
Amazon O
. O

The O
first O
two O
highways O
successfully O
opened O
up O
the O
rainforest O
and O
led O
to O
increased B-KP
settlement I-KP
and I-KP
deforestation I-KP
. O

The O
mean O

These O
variations O
enable O
different O
species O
to O
build O
huge O
populations O
in O
the O

The O

in O
most O
species O
look O
like O
miniature B-KP

gradually O
changing O

In B-KP

capable I-KP
of I-KP
reproduction I-KP
before I-KP

. O

The O
combination B-KP
of I-KP
hermaphroditism I-KP
and I-KP
early I-KP
reproduction I-KP
enables O
small O
populations O

grow O
at O
an O

Ctenophores O

One O
ctenophore O

has O
accidentally O
been O
introduced O
into O
the B-KP
Black B-KP

where O
it O
is O
blamed O
for O
causing B-KP
fish I-KP

to I-KP
collapse I-KP
by O
eating O
both O
fish B-KP
larvae I-KP
and I-KP
organisms I-KP
that I-KP
would I-KP
otherwise I-KP
have I-KP
fed I-KP
the I-KP

The O
situation O
was O
aggravated O
by O
other O
factors O
, O
such O
as O
over B-KP
fishing I-KP
and I-KP
long B-KP
term I-KP
environmental I-KP
changes I-KP
that O
promoted O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
Mnemiopsis O

. O

The O
later O
accidental B-KP
introduction I-KP
of I-KP
Beroe I-KP
helped O
to O
mitigate O
the O
problem O

as O
Beroe O
preys O

Despite O
their O
soft O

The O
position O
of O
the O
ctenophores O
in O
the O
evolutionary O

the O

the O
common O
ancestor O

ctenophores O
was O
cydippid O

and O
that O
all O
the O

probably O
after O

Evidence O
accumulating O
since O
the O
1980s O
indicates O
that O
the O
`` O
cydippids O
'' O
are O
not O
monophyletic B-KP
, O
in O
other O
words O
do O
not O
include O
all O
and O
only O
the O
descendants O
of O
a O
single O
common O
ancestor O
, O
because O
all O
the O
other O
traditional O
ctenophore O
groups O
are O
descendants O
of O
various O
cydippids O
. O

Ctenophores B-KP
form O
an O
animal O
phylum O
that O
is O
more O
complex O
than O
sponges O
, O
about O
as O
complex O
as O
cnidarians B-KP
( O
jellyfish O
, O
sea O
anemones O
, O
etc O
. O

) O
, O
and O
less O
complex O
than O
bilaterians B-KP
( O
which O
include O
almost O
all O
other O
animals O
) O
. O

Unlike O
sponges O
, O
both O
ctenophores B-KP
and I-KP
cnidarians I-KP
have O
: O
cells O
bound O
by O
inter O
cell O
connections O
and O
carpet O
like O
basement O
membranes O
; O
muscles O
; O
nervous O
systems O
; O
and O
some O
have O
sensory O
organs O
. O

Ctenophores O
are O
distinguished O
from O
all O
other O
animals O
by B-KP
having B-KP
colloblasts B-KP
, O
which O
are O
sticky O
and O
adhere O
to O
prey O
, O
although O
a O
few O
ctenophore O
species O
lack O
them O
. O

Like O
sponges B-KP
and I-KP
cnidarians I-KP
, I-KP
ctenophores B-KP
have O
two O
main O
layers O
of O
cells O
that O
sandwich O
a O
middle O
layer O
of O
jelly O
like O
material O
, O
which O
is O
called O
the O
mesoglea B-KP
in O
cnidarians B-KP
and I-KP
ctenophores I-KP
; O
more O
complex O
animals O
have O
three O
main O
cell O
layers O
and O
no O
intermediate O
jelly O
like O
layer O
. O

Hence O
ctenophores O
and O
cnidarians O
have O
traditionally O
been O
labelled O
diploblastic B-KP
, O
along O
with O
sponges B-KP
. O

Both O
ctenophores O
and O
cnidarians O
have O
a O
type O
of O
muscle O
that O
, O
in O
more O
complex O
animals O
, O
arises O
from O
the O
middle O
cell O
layer O
, O
and O
as O
a O
result O
some O
recent O
text O
books O
classify O
ctenophores O
as O
triploblastic O
, O
while O
others O
still O
regard O
them O
as O
diploblastic O
. O

The O
name O
`` O
ctenophora O
'' O
means O
`` O
comb B-KP

'' O
, O
from O
the O
Greek O
( O

) O
meaning O
`` O
comb O
'' O
and O
the O
Greek O

meaning O
`` O

For O
a O

relatively O
few O
species O

ctenophores O
have O
a O
wide O
range O

It B-KP
is I-KP
uncertain I-KP
how O
ctenophores O
control O

but O
experiments O

that O
some O

Their O

If O
they O
enter O
less O
dense O
brackish O
water O
, O
the O
ciliary O
rosettes O
in O
the O

increase B-KP
its I-KP

Conversely O
if O
they O
move O
from O
brackish O
to O
full O
strength O
seawater O
, O
the O
rosettes O
may O
pump B-KP
water I-KP
out I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
mesoglea I-KP
to O
reduce O
its O

The O
largest O

is O
the O
aboral B-KP
organ I-KP
( O
at B-KP
the B-KP

. O

Its O
main O
component O
is O
a B-KP
statocyst B-KP
, O
a B-KP
balance I-KP
sensor I-KP
consisting I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
statolith I-KP
, O
a O
solid O
particle O
supported O
on O
four O
bundles O
of O
cilia O
, O
called O
`` O
balancers O
'' O
, O
that O
sense O
its O
orientation O
. O

The O
statocyst O
is O
protected O
by O
a B-KP
transparent B-KP
dome I-KP
made I-KP
of I-KP
long I-KP
, I-KP
immobile I-KP
cilia I-KP

A O
ctenophore O
does O
not O
automatically O
try O
to O
keep O
the O
statolith O
resting O
equally O
on O
all O
the O
balancers O
. O

Instead O
its O
response O
is O
determined O
by O
the O
animal O
's O
`` O

'' O
, O
in O
other O
words O
the O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
ctenophore O
with O
trailing O
tentacles O
captures O
prey O
, O
it O
will O
often O
put O
some O
comb O
rows O
into O
reverse O
, O
spinning O
the O

Cydippid O
ctenophores O
have O
bodies O
that O
are O
more B-KP
or I-KP
less I-KP
rounded I-KP
, O
sometimes O
nearly O
spherical O
and O
other O
times O
more O
cylindrical O
or O
egg O
shaped O
; O
the O
common O
coastal O
`` O
sea B-KP
gooseberry I-KP
, O
'' O
Pleurobrachia O
, O
sometimes O
has O
an O
egg B-KP
shaped I-KP
body O
with O
the O
mouth O
at B-KP
the I-KP
narrow I-KP
end I-KP
, O
although O
some O
individuals O
are O
more O
uniformly O
round O
. O

From O
opposite O
sides O
of O
the O
body O
extends O
a B-KP
pair I-KP
of I-KP
long I-KP
, I-KP
slender I-KP
tentacles I-KP
, O
each O
housed O
in O
a B-KP
sheath I-KP
into I-KP
which I-KP
it I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
withdrawn I-KP
. O

Some O
species O
of O
cydippids O
have O
bodies O
that O
are O
flattened O
to O
various O
extents O
, O
so O
that O
they O
are O
wider O
in O
the O
plane O
of O
the O
tentacles O
. O

The O
tentacles O
of O
cydippid O
ctenophores O
are O
typically O
fringed O
with O
tentilla B-KP
( O
`` O
little O
tentacles O
'' O
) O
, O
although O
a O
few O
genera O
have O
simple O
tentacles O
without O
these O
sidebranches O
. O

The O
tentacles O
and O
tentilla O
are O
densely O
covered O
with O
microscopic O
colloblasts O
that O
capture O
prey O
by O
sticking O
to O
it O
. O

Colloblasts O
are O
specialized B-KP
mushroom I-KP
shaped I-KP
cells I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
outer I-KP
layer I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
epidermis I-KP
, O
and O
have O
three O
main O
components O
: O
a O
domed O
head O
with O
vesicles O
( O
chambers O
) O
that O
contain O
adhesive O
; O
a O
stalk O
that O
anchors O
the O
cell O
in O
the O
lower O
layer O
of O
the O
epidermis O
or O
in O
the O
mesoglea O
; O
and O
a O
spiral O
thread O
that O
coils O
round O
the O
stalk O
and O
is O
attached O
to O
the O
head O
and O
to O
the O
root O
of O
the O
stalk O
. O

The O
function O
of O
the O
spiral O
thread O
is O
uncertain O
, O
but O
it O
may O
absorb O
stress O
when O
prey O
tries O
to O
escape O
, O
and O
thus O
prevent O
the O
collobast O
from O
being O
torn O
apart O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
colloblasts O
, O
members O
of O
the O
genus O
Haeckelia O
, O
which O
feed O
mainly O
on O
jellyfish O
, O
incorporate O
their O
victims O
' O
stinging O
nematocytes O
into O
their O
own O
tentacles O
some O
cnidaria O
eating O
nudibranchs O
similarly O
incorporate O
nematocytes O
into O
their O
bodies O
for O
defense O
. O

The O
tentilla O
of O
Euplokamis O
differ O
significantly O
from O
those O
of O
other O
cydippids O
: O
they B-KP
contain I-KP
striated I-KP
muscle I-KP
, I-KP
a O
cell O
type O
otherwise O
unknown O
in O
the O
phylum O
Ctenophora O
; O
and O
they O
are O
coiled O
when O
relaxed O
, O
while O
the O
tentilla O
of O
all O
other O
known O
ctenophores O
elongate O
when O
relaxed O
. O

Euplokamis O
' O
tentilla O
have O
three B-KP
types I-KP
of I-KP
movement I-KP
that O
are O
used O
in O
capturing B-KP
prey I-KP
: O
they O
may O
flick O
out O
very O
quickly O
( O
in O
40 O
to O
60 O
milliseconds O
) O
; O
they O
can O
wriggle O
, O
which O
may O
lure O
prey O
by O
behaving O
like O
small O
planktonic O
worms O
; O
and O
they O
coil O
round O
prey O
. O

The O
unique O
flicking O
is O
an O
uncoiling O
movement O
powered O
by O
contraction O
of O
the O
striated O
muscle O
. O

The O
wriggling O
motion O
is O
produced O
by O
smooth O
muscles O
, O
but O
of O
a O
highly O
specialized O
type O
. O

Coiling O
around O
prey O
is O
accomplished O
largely O
by O
the O
return O
of O
the O
tentilla O
to O
their O
inactive O
state O
, O
but O
the O
coils O
may O
be O
tightened O
by O
smooth O
muscle O
. O

There O
are O
eight B-KP
rows I-KP
of O
combs O
that O
run O
from B-KP
near B-KP
the I-KP
mouth I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
opposite I-KP
end I-KP
, O
and O
are O
spaced O
evenly B-KP
round I-KP
the I-KP
body I-KP
. O

The O
`` O
combs O
'' O
beat O
in O
a O
metachronal O
rhythm O
rather O
like O
that O
of O
a O
Mexican O
wave O
. O

From O
each O
balancer O
in O
the O
statocyst O
a B-KP
ciliary I-KP
groove I-KP
runs O
out O
under O
the O
dome O
and O
then O
splits O
to O
connect O
with O
two O
adjacent O
comb O
rows O
, O
and O
in O
some O
species O
runs O
all O
the O
way O
along O
the O
comb O
rows O
. O

This O
forms O
a O
mechanical O
system O
for O
transmitting O
the O
beat O
rhythm O
from O
the O
combs O
to O
the O
balancers O
, O
via O
water O
disturbances O
created O
by O
the O
cilia O
. O

The O
Lobata O
have O
a O
pair O
of O
lobes B-KP
, O
which O
are O
muscular O
, O
cuplike O
extensions O
of O
the O
body O
that O
project O
beyond O
the O
mouth O
. O

Their O
inconspicuous O
tentacles O
originate O
from O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
mouth O
, O
running O
in O
convoluted O
grooves O
and O
spreading O
out O
over O
the O
inner O
surface O
of O
the O
lobes O
( O
rather O
than O
trailing O
far O
behind O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Cydippida O
) O
. O

Between O
the O
lobes O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
mouth O
, O
many O
species O
of O
lobates O
have O

Since O

most O

tolerate O
a O
wide O
range O
of O

The O
impact O
was O
increased O
by O
chronic O
overfishing O

and O
by O
eutrophication O
that O
gave O
the O
entire O
ecosystem O
a O
short O
term O
boost O
, O
causing O
the O
Mnemiopsis O
population O
to O
increase O
even O
faster O
than O
normal O
and O
above O
all O
by O
the O
absence O
of O

Mnemiopsis O

anything O
found O
in O
living O
ctenophores O
. O

One O
of O
the O
fossil O
species O
first O
reported O
in O
1996 O
had O
a O
large O
mouth O
, O
apparently O
surrounded O
by O
a O
folded O
edge O
that O
may O
have O
been O
muscular O
. O

Evidence O
from O
China O
a O
year O
later O
suggests O
that O
such O
ctenophores O
were O
widespread O
in O
the O
Cambrian O
, O
but O
perhaps O
very O
different O
from O
modern O
species O
for O
example O
one O
fossil O
's O
comb O
rows O
were O
mounted O
on O
prominent O
vanes O
. O

The O
Ediacaran O

could O
putatively O
represent O
a B-KP
comb I-KP

The O
early O

fossil I-KP

from O
China O

Chengjiang O

and O
dated O
to O
about B-KP
515 B-KP
million I-KP
years I-KP
ago O
, O
is O
very O
similar O
to O
Vendobionta B-KP
of O
the O
preceding O
Ediacaran B-KP
period I-KP

found O
on O
its O
branches O
what O
they O
considered O
rows O
of O
cilia O
, O
used O
for O
filter O
feeding O
. O

They O
suggested O
that O
Stromatoveris B-KP
was O
an O
evolutionary O
`` O
aunt O
'' O
of O
ctenophores B-KP
, O
and O
that O
ctenophores O
originated O
from O
sessile O
animals O
whose O
descendants O
became O
swimmers O
and O
changed O
the O
cilia O
from O
a O
feeding O
mechanism O
to O
a O

system O
. O

The O
relationship O
of O
ctenophores O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
Metazoa O
is O
very O
important O
to O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
early O
evolution O
of O
animals O
and O
the O
origin O
of O
multicellularity O
. O

It O
has O
been O
the O
focus O
of O
debate O
for O
many O
years O
. O

Ctenophores O
have O
been O
purported O
to O
be O
the O
sister O
lineage O
to O
the O
Bilateria B-KP
, O
sister O
to O
the O
Cnidaria O
, O
sister O
to O
Cnidaria O
, O
Placozoa O
and O
Bilateria B-KP
, O
and O
sister O
to O
all O
other O
animal O
phyla O
. O

A O
series O
of O
studies O
that O
looked O
at O
the O
presence O
and O
absence O
of O
members O
of O
gene O
families O
and O
signalling O
pathways O
( O
e.g. O
, O
homeoboxes O
, O
nuclear O
receptors O
, O
the O
Wnt O
signaling O
pathway O
, O
and O
sodium O
channels O
) O
showed O
evidence O
congruent O
with O
the O
latter O
two O
scenarios O
, O
that O
ctenophores O
are O
either O
sister O
to O
Cnidaria O
, O
Placozoa O
and O
Bilateria O
or O
sister O
to O
all O
other O
animal O
phyla O
. O

Several O
more O
recent O
studies O
comparing O
complete O
sequenced O
genomes O
of O
ctenophores O
with O
other O
sequenced O
animal O
genomes O
have O
also O
supported O
ctenophores O
as O
the O
sister O
lineage O
to O
all B-KP
other I-KP
animals I-KP
. O

This O
position O
would O
suggest O
that O
neural O
and O
muscle O
cell O
types O
were O
either O
lost O
in O
major O
animal O
lineages O
( O
e.g. O
, O
Porifera O
) O
or O
that O
they O
evolved O
independently O
in O
the O
ctenophore O
lineage O
. O

However O
, O
other O
researchers O
have O
argued O
that O
the O
placement O
of O
Ctenophora O
as O
sister O
to O
all O
other O
animals O
is O
a O
statistical O
anomaly O
caused O
by O
the O
high O
rate O
of O
evolution O
in O
ctenophore O
genomes O
, O
and O
that O
Porifera B-KP
( O
sponges O
) O
is O
the O
earliest O
diverging O
animal O
phylum O
instead O
. O

Ctenophores O
and O
sponges O
are O
also O
the O
only O
known O
animal O
phyla O
that O
lack O
any O
true O
hox O
genes O
. O

Since O
all O
modern O
ctenophores O
except O
the O
beroids B-KP
have O
cydippid O
like O
larvae O
, O
it O
has O
widely O
been O
assumed O
that O
their O
last O
common O
ancestor O
also O
resembled O
cydippids O
, O
having O
an O
egg O
shaped O
body O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
retractable O
tentacles O
. O

Richard B-KP
Harbison I-KP
's O
purely O
morphological O
analysis O
in O
1985 O
concluded O
that O
the O
cydippids O
are O
not O
monophyletic B-KP
, O
in O
other O
words O
do O
not O
contain O
all O
and O
only O
the O
descendants O
of O
a O
single O
common O
ancestor O
that O
was O
itself O
a O
cydippid O
. O

Instead O
he O
found O
that O
various O
cydippid O
families O
were O
more O
similar O
to O
members O
of O
other O
ctenophore O
orders O
than O
to O
other O
cydippids O
. O

He O
also O
suggested O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
either O
cydippid O
like O
or O
beroid O
like O
. O

A O
molecular O
phylogeny O
analysis O
in O
2001 O
, O
using O
26 O
species O
, O
including O
4 O
recently O
discovered O
ones O
, O
confirmed O
that O
the O
cydippids O
are O
not O
monophyletic B-KP
and O
concluded O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
cydippid O
like O
. O

It O
also O
found O
that O
the O
genetic O
differences O
between O
these O
species O
were O
very O
small O
so O
small O
that O
the O
relationships O
between O
the O
Lobata O
, O
Cestida O
and O
Thalassocalycida O
remained O
uncertain O
. O

This O
suggests O
that O
the O
last O
common O
ancestor O
of O
modern O
ctenophores O
was O
relatively O
recent O
, O
and O
perhaps O
was O
lucky O
enough O
to O
survive O
the O
Cretaceous O
Paleogene O
extinction O
event O
65.5 B-KP
million I-KP
years I-KP
ago I-KP
while O
other O
lineages O
perished O
. O

When O
the O
analysis O
was O
broadened O
to O
include O
representatives O
of O
other O
phyla O
, O
it O
concluded O
that O
cnidarians O
are O
probably O
more O
closely O
related O
to O
bilaterians O
than O
either O
group O
is O
to O
ctenophores O
but O
that O
this O
diagnosis O
is O
uncertain O
. O

circa O
1910 O
, O
on O
190 O

was O
officially O

in O
an O

At O
the O

In O

Baran O

work O

A O
member O
of O
Davies O
' O
team O
( O
Roger O
Scantlebury O
) O
met O
Lawrence O
Roberts O
at O
the O
1967 O
ACM O
Symposium O
on O
Operating O
System O
Principles O
and O
suggested B-KP
it I-KP
for I-KP
use B-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
ARPANET I-KP
. O

In O
connectionless O
mode O
each B-KP
packet I-KP
includes I-KP
complete B-KP
addressing I-KP
information I-KP
. O

The O
packets O
are O
routed O
individually B-KP
, I-KP
sometimes I-KP
resulting I-KP
in I-KP
different I-KP
paths I-KP
and I-KP
out I-KP
of I-KP
order I-KP
delivery I-KP
. O

Each B-KP
packet I-KP
is I-KP
labeled I-KP
with I-KP
a I-KP
destination B-KP
address I-KP
, I-KP
source I-KP
address I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
port I-KP
numbers I-KP
. I-KP
It I-KP
may I-KP
also I-KP
be I-KP
labeled I-KP
with I-KP
the I-KP
sequence I-KP
number I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
packet I-KP
. O

This O
precludes O
the O
need O
for O
a O
dedicated O
path O
to O
help O
the O
packet O
find O
its O
way O
to O
its O
destination O
, O
but O
means O
that O
much O
more O
information O
is O
needed O
in O
the O
packet O
header O
, O
which O
is O
therefore O
larger O
, O
and O
this O
information O
needs O
to O
be O
looked O
up O
in O
power O
hungry O
content O
addressable O
memory O
. O

Each O
packet O
is O
dispatched O
and O
may O
go O
via O
different O
routes O
; O
potentially O
, O
the O
system O
has O
to O
do O
as O
much O
work O
for O
every O
packet O
as O
the O
connection O
oriented O
system O
has O
to O
do O
in O
connection O
set O
up O
, O
but O
with O
less O
information O
as O
to O
the O
application O
's O
requirements O
. O

At O
the O
destination O
, O
the B-KP
original I-KP
message/data I-KP
is I-KP
reassembled B-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
correct I-KP
order I-KP
, I-KP
based I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP

. O

Thus O
a O
virtual O
connection O
, O
also O
known O
as O
a O
virtual O
circuit O
or O
byte O
stream O
is O
provided O
to O
the O
end O
user O
by O
a O
transport O
layer O
protocol O
, O
although O
intermediate O
network O
nodes O
only O
provides O
a O
connectionless O
network O
layer O
service O
. O

Connection O
oriented O
transmission O
requires O
a B-KP
setup B-KP
phase I-KP
in I-KP
each I-KP
involved I-KP
node I-KP
before I-KP
any I-KP
packet I-KP
is I-KP
transferred I-KP
to I-KP
establish I-KP
the I-KP
parameters I-KP
of I-KP
communication I-KP
. O

The O
packets O
include O
a B-KP
connection I-KP
identifier I-KP
rather I-KP
than I-KP
address I-KP
information I-KP
and I-KP
are I-KP
negotiated B-KP
between I-KP
endpoints I-KP
so I-KP
that I-KP
they I-KP
are I-KP
delivered I-KP
in I-KP
order I-KP
and I-KP
with I-KP
error I-KP
checking I-KP
. O

Address O
information O
is O
only O
transferred O
to O
each O
node O
during O
the O
connection O
set O
up O
phase O
, O
when O
the O

discovered O
and O
an O

is O
added O
to O
the O
switching O
table O
in O
each O
network O
node O
through O
which O
the O
connection O
passes O
. O

The O
signaling O
protocols O
used O
allow O
the O
application O
to O
specify O
its O
requirements O
and O
discover O

parameters O
. O

Acceptable O

may O
be O

. O

Routing B-KP
a I-KP
packet I-KP
requires I-KP
the I-KP
node I-KP
to I-KP
look I-KP
up I-KP
the B-KP
connection B-KP
id I-KP
in I-KP
a I-KP
table I-KP
. O

The B-KP
packet I-KP
header I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
small B-KP
, I-KP
as I-KP
it I-KP
only I-KP
needs I-KP
to I-KP
contain I-KP
this I-KP
code I-KP
and I-KP
any I-KP
information I-KP
, I-KP
such I-KP
as I-KP
length I-KP
, I-KP
timestamp I-KP
, I-KP
or I-KP
sequence I-KP
number I-KP
, O
which O
is O
different O
for O
different O
packets O
. O

Both O
X.25 O
and O
Frame O
Relay O
provide B-KP
connection I-KP
oriented I-KP
operations I-KP
. I-KP
But I-KP
X.25 I-KP
does I-KP
it I-KP
at I-KP
the I-KP
network I-KP
layer I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
OSI I-KP
Model I-KP
. I-KP
Frame I-KP
Relay I-KP
does I-KP
it I-KP
at I-KP
level I-KP
two I-KP
, I-KP
the I-KP
data I-KP
link I-KP
layer I-KP
. O

Another O
major O
difference O
between O
X.25 O
and O
Frame O
Relay O
is O
that O
X.25 O
requires O
a B-KP
handshake I-KP
between I-KP
the I-KP
communicating I-KP
parties I-KP
before I-KP
any I-KP
user I-KP
packets I-KP
are I-KP
transmitted I-KP
. O

Frame O
Relay O
does O
not O
define O
any O
such O
handshakes O
. O

X.25 O
does O
not O
define O
any O
operations O
inside O
the O
packet O
network O
. O

It O
only O
operates O
at O
the O
user O
network O
interface O
( O
UNI O
) O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
network O
provider O
is O
free O
to O
use O
any O
procedure O
it O
wishes O
inside O
the O
network O
. O

X.25 O
does O
specify O
some O
limited O
re O
transmission O
procedures O
at O
the O
UNI O
, O
and O
its O
link O
layer O
protocol O
( O
LAPB O
) O
provides O
conventional O
HDLC O
type O
link O
management O
procedures O
. O

Frame O
Relay O
is O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
ISDN O
's O
layer O
two O
protocol O
, O
LAPD O
and O
LAPB O
. O

As O
such O
, O
its O
integrity O
operations O
pertain O
only O
between O
nodes O
on O
a O
link O
, O
not O
end O
to O
end O
. O

Any O
retransmissions O
must O
be O
carried O
out O
by O
higher O
layer O
protocols O
. O

The O
X.25 O
UNI O
protocol O
is O
part O
of O
the O
X.25 O
protocol O
suite O
, O
which O
consists O
of O
the O
lower O
three O
layers O
of O
the O
OSI O
Model O
. O

It O
was O
widely O
used O
at O
the O
UNI O
for O
packet O
switching O
networks O
during O
the O
1980s O
and O
early O
1990s O
, O
to O
provide O
a O
standardized B-KP
interface I-KP
into O
and O
out O
of O
packet O
networks O
. O

Some O
implementations O
used O
X.25 O
within O
the O
network O
as O
well O
, O
but O
its O
connection O
oriented O
features O
made O
this O
setup O
cumbersome O
and O
inefficient O
. O

Frame O
relay O
operates O
principally O
at O
layer O
two O
of O
the O
OSI O
Model O
. O

However O
, O
its O
address O
field O
( O
the O
Data O
Link O
Connection O
ID O
, O
or O
DLCI O
) O
can O
be O
used O
at O
the O
OSI O
network O
layer O
, O
with O
a O
minimum O
set O
of O
procedures O
. O

Thus O
, O
it O
rids O
itself O
of O
many O
X.25 O
layer O
3 O
encumbrances O
, O
but O
still O
has O
the O
DLCI O
as O
an O
ID O
beyond O
a O
node O
to O
node O
layer O
two O
link O
protocol O
. O

The O
simplicity O
of O
Frame O
Relay O
makes O
it O
faster O
and O
more O
efficient O
than O
X.25 O
. O

Because O
Frame O
relay O
is O
a O
data O
link O
layer O
protocol O
, O
like O
X.25 O
it O
does O
not O
define O
internal O
network O
routing O
operations O
. O

For O
X.25 O
its O
packet O
IDs O
the O
virtual O
circuit O
and O
virtual O
channel O
numbers O
have O
to O
be O
correlated O
to O
network O
addresses O
. O

The O
same O
is O
true O
for O
Frame O
Relays O
DLCI O
. O

How O
this O
is O
done O
is O
up O
to O
the O
network O
provider O
. O

Frame O
Relay O
, O
by O
virtue O
of O

X.25 O

are O
typically O
established O
for O
each O

but O
it O
does O
have O
a O

The O
most O

account O
at O

came O
from O
the O

in O

in O
a O
report O
to O
the B-KP
king B-KP

that O

`` O

This O
report O
became O
the O
first O
and O
most O
widely O
circulated O

sought O
to O
give O
advice O

. O

That B-KP
the I-KP
plague I-KP
was I-KP
caused I-KP
by I-KP
bad B-KP
air I-KP
became O
the O
most O
widely O
accepted O
theory O
. O

Today O
, O
this O
is O
known O
as O
the O
Miasma B-KP
theory I-KP

The O
word O
'plague O
' O
had O
no O
special O
significance O
at O
this O
time O
, O
and O
only O
the O
recurrence O

during O
the O
Middle O

gave O
it O
the O
name O
that O
has O
become O
the O
medical O
term O
. O

The O
dominant O
explanation O
for O
the O
Black O
Death O
is O
the O
plague O
theory O
, O
which O
attributes O
the O
outbreak O
to O
Yersinia B-KP
pestis I-KP
, O
also O
responsible O
for O
an O
epidemic O
that O
began O
in O
southern O
China O
in O
1865 O
, O
eventually O
spreading O
to O
India O
. O

The O
investigation O
of O
the O
pathogen O
that O
caused O
the O
19th O
century O
plague O
was O
begun O
by O
teams O
of O
scientists O
who O
visited O
Hong B-KP
Kong I-KP
in I-KP
1894 I-KP
, O
among O
whom O
was O
the O
French B-KP
Swiss I-KP
bacteriologist I-KP
Alexandre B-KP
Yersin I-KP
, O
after O
whom O
the O
pathogen O
was O
named O
Yersinia O
pestis O
. O

The B-KP
mechanism I-KP
by I-KP
which I-KP
Y. I-KP
pestis I-KP
was I-KP
usually I-KP
transmitted I-KP
was O
established O
in O
1898 O
by O
Paul O
Louis O
Simond O
and O
was O
found O
to O
involve O
the O
bites O
of O
fleas O
whose O
midguts O
had O
become O
obstructed O
by O
replicating O
Y. O
pestis O
several O
days O
after O
feeding O
on O
an O
infected O
host O
. O

This O
blockage O
results O
in O
starvation O
and O
aggressive O
feeding O
behaviour O
by O
the O
fleas O
, O
which O
repeatedly O
attempt O
to O
clear O
their O
blockage O
by O
regurgitation O
, O
resulting O
in O
thousands O
of O
plague O
bacteria O
being O
flushed O
into O
the O
feeding O
site O
, O
infecting O
the O
host O
. O

The O
bubonic O
plague O
mechanism O
was O
also O
dependent O
on O
two B-KP
populations I-KP
of I-KP
rodents I-KP
: O
one O
resistant O
to O
the O
disease O
, O
which O
act O
as O
hosts O
, O
keeping O
the O
disease O
endemic O
, O
and O
a O
second O
that O
lack O
resistance O
. O

When O
the O
second O
population O
dies O
, O
the O
fleas O
move O
on O
to O
other O
hosts O
, O
including O
people O
, O
thus O
creating O
a O
human O
epidemic O
. O

The O

Francis B-KP
Aidan I-KP
Gasquet I-KP

about O
the O
'Great O

Many O

on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
Earth O
and O
the B-KP
convecting I-KP
mantle I-KP
is O
called O
plate O
tectonics O
. O

The O
development O
of O
plate O
tectonics O
provided O
a O
physical O
basis O
for O
many O
observations O
of O
the O
solid O
Earth O
. O

Long O
linear O
regions O
of O
geologic O

could O
be O
explained O
as O
plate O

Mid O
ocean O
ridges O
, O
high O
regions O
on O
the O
seafloor O
where O
hydrothermal O
vents O

exist O
, O
were O
explained O
as O
divergent B-KP
boundaries I-KP
, O
where O
two O
plates O
move O
apart O
. O

Arcs O
of O

were O
explained O
as O
convergent B-KP

where O
one O

Transform B-KP

, O
such O
as O
the O
San O

system O
, O
resulted O
in O
widespread O
powerful O

. O

Plate O
tectonics O
also O
provided O
a O
mechanism O
for O
Alfred B-KP
Wegener I-KP
's O
theory O
of O
continental O
drift O
, O
in O
which O
the O
continents O
move O
across O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
Earth O
over O

time O
. O

They O
also O
provided O
a O

force O
for O
crustal O

, O
and O
a O
new O
setting O
for O
the O
observations O

. O

The O
power O
of O
the O
theory O
of O
plate O
tectonics O
lies O
in O
its O
ability O
to O
combine O
all O
of O
these O
observations O
into O
a O
single O
theory O
of O
how O
the O
lithosphere O
moves O
over O
the B-KP

mantle I-KP
. O

Seismologists O
can O
use O
the O
arrival O
times O
of O
seismic B-KP
waves I-KP
in O
reverse O
to O
image O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
Earth O
. O

Early O
advances O
in O
this O
field O
showed O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
liquid O
outer O
core O
( O
where O
shear O
waves O
were O
not O
able O
to O
propagate O
) O
and O
a O
dense O
solid O
inner O
core O
. O

These O
advances O
led O
to O
the O
development O
of O
a O
layered O
model O
of O
the O
Earth O
, O
with O
a O
crust B-KP
and I-KP
lithosphere I-KP
on O
top O
, O
the B-KP
mantle B-KP
below O
( O
separated O
within O

by O
seismic O

at O
410 O
and O
660 O
kilometers O
) O
, O
and O
the B-KP
outer B-KP
core I-KP
and I-KP
inner I-KP
core I-KP
below O
that O
. O

More O
recently O
, O
seismologists O
have O
been O
able O
to O
create O
detailed O
images O
of O
wave B-KP

inside O
the O
earth O
in O
the O
same O
way O
a O
doctor O
images O
a O
body O
in O
a O
CT O

. O

These O
images O
have O
led O
to O
a O
much O
more O
detailed O
view O
of O
the O
interior O
of O
the O
Earth O
, O
and O
have O
replaced O
the O
simplified O

with O
a O
much O
more O
dynamic O
model O
. O

The O
following O
four O
timelines O
show O
the O
geologic O
time O
scale O
. O

The O
first O
shows O
the O
entire O
time O
from O
the O
formation O
of O
the O
Earth O
to O
the O
present O
, O
but O
this O
compresses O
the O
most O
recent O
eon O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
second B-KP
scale I-KP
shows I-KP
the I-KP
most I-KP
recent I-KP
eon I-KP
with I-KP
an I-KP
expanded I-KP
scale I-KP
. O

The O
second O
scale O
compresses B-KP
the I-KP
most I-KP
recent I-KP
era I-KP
, O
so O
the O
most O
recent O
era O
is O
expanded O
in O
the O
third O
scale O
. O

Since O
the O
Quaternary B-KP
is O
a O
very O
short O
period O
with O
short O
epochs O
, O
it O
is O
further O
expanded O
in O
the O
fourth O
scale O
. O

The O
second O
, O
third O
, O
and O
fourth O
timelines O
are O
therefore O
each O
subsections O
of O
their O
preceding O
timeline O
as O
indicated O
by O
asterisks O
. O

The B-KP
Holocene B-KP
( O
the O
latest O
epoch O
) O
is O
too O
small O
to O
be O
shown O
clearly O
on O
the O
third O
timeline O
on O
the O
right O
, O
another O
reason O
for O
expanding O
the O
fourth O
scale O
. O

The O
Pleistocene O
( O
P O
) O
epoch O
. O

Q O
stands O
for O
the B-KP
Quaternary B-KP
period I-KP
. O

The B-KP
principle I-KP
of I-KP
cross B-KP
cutting I-KP
relationships I-KP
pertains O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
faults O
and O
the O
age O
of O
the O
sequences O
through O
which O
they O
cut O
. O

Faults O
are O
younger B-KP
than O
the O
rocks O
they O
cut O
; O
accordingly O
, O
if O
a O
fault O
is O
found O
that O
penetrates O
some O
formations O
but O
not O
those O
on O
top O
of O
it O
, O
then O
the O
formations O
that O
were O
cut O
are O
older B-KP
than I-KP
the I-KP
fault I-KP
, O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
are O
not O
cut O
must O
be O
younger B-KP
than I-KP
the I-KP
fault I-KP
. O

Finding O
the B-KP
key B-KP
bed I-KP
in O
these O
situations O
may O
help O
determine O
whether O
the O
fault O
is O
a O
normal O
fault O
or O
a O
thrust O
fault O
. O

The B-KP
principle I-KP
of I-KP
inclusions B-KP
and I-KP
components I-KP
states O
that O
, O
with O
sedimentary O
rocks O
, O
if O
inclusions O
( O
or O
clasts B-KP
) O
are O
found O
in O
a O
formation O
, O
then O
the O
inclusions B-KP
must O
be O
older O
than O
the O
formation O
that O
contains O
them O
. O

For O
example O
, O
in O
sedimentary O
rocks O
, O
it O
is O
common O
for O
gravel B-KP
from O
an O
older O
formation O
to O
be O
ripped O
up O
and O
included O
in O
a O
newer O
layer O
. O

A O
similar O
situation O
with O
igneous O
rocks O
occurs O
when O
xenoliths B-KP
are O
found O
. O

These O
foreign O
bodies O
are O
picked O
up O
as O
magma B-KP
or I-KP
lava I-KP
flows I-KP
, O
and O
are O
incorporated O
, O
later O
to O
cool O
in O
the O
matrix O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
xenoliths B-KP
are O
older O
than O
the O
rock O
which O
contains O
them O
. O

The B-KP
principle I-KP
of I-KP
faunal B-KP
succession I-KP
is O
based O
on O
the O
appearance O
of O
fossils O
in O
sedimentary O
rocks O
. O

As O
organisms B-KP
exist O
at O
the O
same O
time O
period O
throughout O
the O
world O
, O
their O
presence O
or O
( O
sometimes O
) O
absence O
may O
be O
used O
to O
provide O
a O
relative O
age O
of O
the O
formations O
in O
which O
they O
are O
found O
. O

Based O
on O
principles O
laid O
out O
by O
William B-KP
Smith I-KP
almost O
a O
hundred O
years O
before O
the O
publication O
of O
Charles B-KP
Darwin I-KP
's O
theory O
of O
evolution O
, O
the O
principles O
of O
succession O
were O
developed O
independently O
of O
evolutionary O
thought O
. O

The O
principle O
becomes O
quite B-KP
complex I-KP
, O
however O
, O
given O
the O
uncertainties O
of O
fossilization O
, O
the O
localization O
of O
fossil O
types O
due O
to O
lateral O
changes O
in O

globally O
at O

At B-KP
the I-KP
beginning B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
20th I-KP
century I-KP
, O
important O
advancement O
in O
geological O
science O
was O
facilitated O
by O
the O
ability O
to O
obtain O
accurate O
absolute O
dates O
to O
geologic O
events O
using O
radioactive O
isotopes O
and O
other O
methods O
. O

This O
changed O
the O
understanding O
of O
geologic O
time O

Previously O
, O
geologists O
could O
only O
use O
fossils O
and O
stratigraphic B-KP
correlation I-KP
to O
date O
sections O
of O
rock O
relative O
to B-KP
one B-KP
another I-KP
. O

With O
isotopic O
dates O
it O
became O
possible O
to O
assign O
absolute O
ages O
to O
rock B-KP
units I-KP
, O
and O
these O
absolute O
dates O
could O
be O
applied O
to O
fossil B-KP
sequences I-KP
in O
which O
there O
was O
datable O
material O
, O
converting O
the O
old O
relative O
ages O
into O
new B-KP
absolute I-KP
ages I-KP
. O

For O
many O
geologic O
applications O
, O
isotope B-KP
ratios I-KP
of I-KP
radioactive I-KP
elements I-KP
are O
measured O
in O
minerals O
that O

at O
which O
different O
radiometric O
isotopes O
stop O
diffusing O

These O
are O
used O
in O
geochronologic O

These O

a O

Dating B-KP

techniques O
. O

These O
methods O
can O
also O
be O
used O
to O
determine O
ages O
of O
pluton O

Thermochemical B-KP
techniques I-KP
can O
be O
used O
to O

temperature O

within O
the O
crust O
, O
the O

When O
rock O
units O
are O
placed O
under O
horizontal B-KP
compression I-KP
, O
they O
shorten O
and O
become O
thicker O
. O

Because O
rock O
units O
, O
other O
than O
muds O
, O
do O
not O
significantly O
change O
in O
volume O
, O
this O
is O
accomplished O
in O
two O
primary O
ways O
: O
through O
faulting O
and O
folding O
. O

In B-KP
the I-KP
shallow B-KP
crust I-KP
, O
where O
brittle O
deformation O
can O
occur O
, O
thrust O
faults O
form O
, O
which O
cause O
deeper O
rock O
to O
move O
on O
top O
of O
shallower O
rock O
. O

Because O
deeper O
rock O
is O
often O
older O
, O
as O
noted O
by O
the O
principle O
of O
superposition O
, O
this O
can O
result O
in O
older O
rocks O
moving O
on O
top O
of O
younger O
ones O
. O

Movement O
along O
faults O
can O
result O
in O
folding O
, O
either O
because O
the O
faults O
are O
not O
planar O
or O
because O
rock O
layers O
are O
dragged O
along O
, O
forming O
drag O
folds O
as O
slip O
occurs O
along O
the O
fault O
. O

Deeper O
in O
the O
Earth O
, O
rocks O
behave O
plastically O
, O
and O
fold O
instead O
of O
faulting O
. O

These O
folds O
can O
either O
be O
those O
where O
the O
material O
in O
the O
center O
of O
the O
fold O
buckles O
upwards O
, O
creating O
`` O
antiforms B-KP
'' O
, O
or O
where O
it O
buckles O
downwards O
, O
creating O
`` O
synforms B-KP
'' O
. O

If O
the O
tops O
of O
the O
rock O
units O
within O
the O
folds O
remain O
pointing O
upwards O
, O
they O
are O
called O
anticlines B-KP
and I-KP
synclines I-KP
, O
respectively O
. O

If O
some O
of O
the O
units O
in O
the O
fold O
are O
facing O
downward O
, O
the O
structure O
is O
called O
an O
overturned B-KP
anticline I-KP
or O
syncline O
, O
and O
if O
all O
of O
the O
rock O
units O
are O
overturned O
or O
the O
correct O
up O
direction O
is O
unknown O
, O
they O
are O
simply O
called O
by O
the O
most O
general O
terms O
, O
antiforms O
and O
synforms O
. O

Extension B-KP
causes O
the O
rock O
units O
as O
a O
whole O
to O
become O
longer O
and O
thinner O
. O

This O
is O
primarily O
accomplished O
through O
normal B-KP
faulting I-KP
and I-KP
through I-KP
the I-KP
ductile I-KP
stretching I-KP
and I-KP
thinning I-KP
. O

Normal O
faults O
drop O
rock O
units O
that O
are O
higher O
below O
those O
that O
are O
lower O
. O

This O
typically O
results O
in O
younger O
units O
being O
placed O
below O
older O
units O
. O

Stretching O
of O
units O
can O
result O
in O
their O
thinning O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
there O
is O
a O
location O
within B-KP
the I-KP
Maria B-KP
Fold I-KP
and I-KP
Thrust I-KP
Belt I-KP
in O
which O
the O
entire O
sedimentary O

of O
the O
Grand O
Canyon O
can O
be O
seen O
over O
a O
length O
of O
less O
than O
a O
meter O
. O

Rocks O
at O
the O
depth O
to O
be O
ductilely O
stretched O
are O
often O
also O
metamorphosed B-KP
. O

These O
stretched O
rocks O
can O
also O
pinch O
into O
lenses O
, O
known O
as O
boudins B-KP
, O
after O
the O
French O
word O
for O
`` O
sausage O
'' O
, O
because O
of O
their O
visual O
similarity O
. O

The O
addition O
of O
new O
rock O
units O
, O
both O
depositionally O
and O
intrusively O
, O
often O
occurs O
during O
deformation O
. O

Faulting O
and O
other O
deformational O
processes O
result O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
topographic B-KP
gradients I-KP
, O
causing O
material O
on O
the O
rock O
unit O
that O
is O
increasing O
in O
elevation O
to O
be O
eroded O
by O
hillslopes O
and O
channels O
. O

These O
sediments O
are O
deposited O
on O
the O
rock O
unit O
that O
is O
going O
down O
. O

Continual B-KP
motion I-KP
along I-KP
the I-KP
fault I-KP
maintains O
the O
topographic O
gradient O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
movement O
of O
sediment O
, O
and O
continues O
to O
create O
accommodation O
space O
for O
the O
material O
to O
deposit O
. O

Deformational B-KP
events I-KP
are O
often O
also O
associated O
with O
volcanism O
and O
igneous O
activity O
. O

Volcanic O
ashes O
and O
lavas O
accumulate O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
and O
igneous O
intrusions O
enter O
from O
below O
. O

Dikes B-KP
, O
long O
, O
planar O
igneous O
intrusions O
, O
enter O
along O
cracks O
, O
and O
therefore O
often O
form O
in O
large O
numbers O
in B-KP
areas I-KP
that I-KP
are I-KP
being I-KP
actively I-KP
deformed I-KP
. O

This O
can O
result O
in O
the O
emplacement O
of O
dike O
swarms O
, O
such O
as O
those O
that O
are O
observable O
across O
the O
Canadian O

, O
or O
rings O
of O
dikes O
around O
the O
lava O
tube O
of O
a O
volcano O

All O
of O
these O
processes O
do O
not O

occur O
in O
a O
single O
environment O

and O
do O
not O

Among O
the O
most O

This O
was O
to O

In O
these O
early O
years O
the O

cases O
, O
also O
this O
was O
the O
first O
part O
of O
the O
museum O
to O
have O
electric O
lighting O
. O

This O
completed O
the O
northern O
half O
of O
the O
site O
, O
creating O
a O
quadrangle O
with O
the O
garden O
at O
its O
centre O
, O
but O
left O
the O
museum O
without O
a O
proper O
fa O
ade O
. O

In O
1890 O
the O
government O
launched O
a O
competition O
to O
design O
new O
buildings O
for O
the O
museum O
, O
with O
architect O
Alfred O
Waterhouse O
as O
one O
of O
the O
judges O
; O
this O
would O
give O
the O
museum O
a O
new O
imposing O
front O
entrance O
. O

The O
main O
fa O
ade O
, O
built O
from O
red B-KP
brick I-KP
and I-KP
Portland I-KP
stone I-KP
, O
stretches O
720 B-KP
feet I-KP
( O
220 O
m O
) O
along O
Cromwell O
Gardens O
and O
was O
designed O
by O
Aston B-KP
Webb I-KP
after O
winning O
a O
competition O
in O
1891 O
to O
extend O
the O
museum O
. O

Construction O
took O
place O
between O
1899 O
and O
1909 O
. O

Stylistically O
it O
is O
a O
strange O
hybrid O
, O
although O
much O
of O
the O
detail O
belongs O
to O
the O
Renaissance O
there O
are O
medieval O
influences O
at O
work O
. O

The O
main O
entrance O
consisting O
of O
a O
series O
of O
shallow O
arches O
supported O
by O
slender O
columns O
and O
niches O
with O
twin O
doors O
separated O
by O
pier O
is O
Romanesque O
in O
form O
but O
Classical O
in O
detail O
. O

Likewise O
the O
tower O
above O
the O
main O
entrance O
has O
an B-KP
open I-KP
work I-KP
crown I-KP
surmounted I-KP
by I-KP
a I-KP
statue I-KP
of I-KP
fame I-KP
, O
a O
feature O
of O
late O
Gothic O
architecture O
and O
a O
feature O
common O
in O
Scotland O
, O
but O
the O
detail O
is O
Classical O
. O

The O
main O
windows O
to O
the O
galleries O
are O
also O
mullioned O
and O
transomed O
, O
again O
a O
Gothic O
feature O
, O
the B-KP
top I-KP
row I-KP
of I-KP
windows I-KP
are O
interspersed O
with O
statues O
of O
many O
of O
the O
British O
artists O
whose O
work O
is O
displayed O
in O
the O
museum O
. O

Prince B-KP
Albert I-KP
appears O
within O
the O
main O
arch O
above O
the O
twin O
entrances O
, O
Queen B-KP
Victoria I-KP
above O
the O
frame O
around O
the O
arches O
and O
entrance O
, O
sculpted O
by O
Alfred B-KP
Drury I-KP
. I-KP

These O
fa O
ades O
surround O
four B-KP
levels I-KP
of O
galleries O
. O

Other O
areas O
designed O
by O
Webb B-KP
include O
the O
Entrance O
Hall O
and O
Rotunda O
, O
the O
East O
and O
West O
Halls O
, O
the O
areas O
occupied O
by O
the O
shop O
and O
Asian O
Galleries O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Costume O
Gallery O
. O

The O
interior O
makes O
much O
use O
of O
marble B-KP
in O
the O
entrance O
hall O
and O
flanking O
staircases O
, O
although O
the O
galleries O
as O
originally O
designed O
were O
white O
with O
restrained O
classical O
detail O
and O
mouldings O
, O
very O
much O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
elaborate O
decoration O
of O
the O
Victorian O
galleries O
, O
although O
much O
of O
this O
decoration O
was O
removed O
in O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
. O

In O
the O
immediate O
post O
war O
years O
there O
was O
little O
money O
available O
for O
other O
than O
essential O
repairs O
. O

The O
1950s O
and O
early O
1960s O
saw O
little O
in O
the O
way O
of O
building O
work O
; O
the O
first O
major O
work O
was O
the O
creation O
of O
new B-KP
storage I-KP
space I-KP
for I-KP
books I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
Art I-KP
Library I-KP
in O
1966 O
and O
1967 O
. O

This O
involved O
flooring O
over O
Aston O
Webb O
's O
main O
hall O
to O
form O
the O
book O
stacks O
, O
with O
a O
new O
medieval O
gallery O
on O
the O
ground O
floor O
( O
now O
the O
shop O
, O
opened O
in O
2006 O
) O
. O

Then O
the O
lower O
ground O
floor O
galleries O
in O
the O
south O
west O
part O
of O
the O
museum O
were O
redesigned O
, O
opening O
in O
1978 O
to O
form O
the O
new O
galleries O
covering O
Continental O
art O
1600 O
1800 O
( O
late O
Renaissance O
, O
Baroque O
through O
Rococo O
and O
neo O
Classical O
) O
. O

In O
1974 O
the O
museum O
had O
acquired O
what O
is O
now O
the O
Henry B-KP
Cole I-KP
wing I-KP
from O
the O
Royal O
College O
of O
Science O
. O

In O
order O
to O
adapt O
the O
building O
as O
galleries O
, O
all O
the O
Victorian O
interiors O
except O
for O
the O
staircase O
were O
recast O
during O
the O
remodelling O
. O

To O
link O
this O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
museum O
, O
a B-KP
new I-KP
entrance I-KP
building I-KP
was O
constructed O
on O
the O
site O
of O
the O
former O
boiler O
house O
, O
the O
intended O
site O
of O
the B-KP
Spiral I-KP
, I-KP
between O
1978 O
and O
1982 O
. O

This O
building O
is O
of O
concrete O
and O
very O
functional O
, O
the O
only O
embellishment O
being O
the O
iron O
gates O
by O
Christopher B-KP
Hay I-KP
and I-KP
Douglas I-KP
Coyne I-KP
of O
the O
Royal O

. O

These O
are O
set O
in O
the O
columned O
screen O

designed O
by O
Aston O
Webb O
that O
forms O
the O
fa O

A O

This O
included O
two O
of O
the O
ten O
columns O
having O
their O
ceramic O
decoration O
replaced O
and O
the O

The O
NBC B-KP
Blue I-KP
Network I-KP
was O
created O
in O
1927 O
for O
the O
primary O
purpose O
of O
testing O

In O

its O
report O
on O

the O
FCC O
, O
RCA O
was O
using O

eliminate O
any O

Having O
no O
power O
over O
the O

themselves O
, O
the O
FCC O
established O
a O

Once O

were O
rejected O
, O
RCA O
decided O
to O

, O

gave O
the O
mandate O

the O
United B-KP
States I-KP
, O
although O
the O
network O

programming O
is O
syndicated O

The O
policy O
regarding O
wholly O
owned O
international O
networks O
was O
revived O
in O
2004 O
when O
on O
September O
27 O
of O
that O
year O
, O
ABC O
announced O
the O
launch O
of O
ABC1 B-KP
, O
a O
free O
to O
air O
channel O
in O
the O
United O

However O
, O
on O
September B-KP
8 I-KP
, I-KP
2007 I-KP
, O
Disney O
announced O
that O
it O
would O
discontinue O

to O
the O

inability O

With O
ABC1 O

shutdown O
that O
October O
, O
the O
company O
's O
attempt O
to O
develop O
ABC B-KP
International I-KP
were O
discontinued O
. O

The O
idea O
was O
to O
create O
a O
network O
of O
wholly O
and O
partially O
owned O
channels O
, O
and O
affiliates O
to O
rebroadcast O
the O
network O

In O
1959 B-KP

this O

with O
ABC O

selling O

to O

not O
owned O
by O
ABC O
. O

The B-KP
arrival I-KP
of I-KP
satellite B-KP
television I-KP
ended O
the O
need O
for O
ABC O
to O
hold O
interests O
in O
other O
countries O
; O
many O
governments B-KP
also I-KP
wanted I-KP
to I-KP
increase I-KP
their I-KP

strengthen I-KP

limit I-KP
foreign I-KP

As O
a O
result O
, O
ABC O
was O
forced O
to O

mainly O
in O

While O
its O

ABC O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
avoid O
falling O
behind O
on O
the O

of O

. O

To O
ensure O
a O
space O
, O
in O
1947 B-KP
, O
ABC O
submitted O
five O
applications O
for O
television O
station O
licenses O
, O
one O
for O
each O
market O
where O
it O
owned O
and O
operated O
a O

, O
Los O

, O

. O

These O
applications O
all O
requested O
for O
the O
stations O
to O
broadcast O
on O

, O
as O
Frank B-KP
Marx I-KP
, O
then O
ABC O

vice O
president O
of O

, O
thought O
that O
the O
low B-KP
band I-KP
VHF I-KP
frequencies O
( O
corresponding O
to O
channels B-KP
2 B-KP
through I-KP
6 I-KP
) O

be O
requisitioned O

reallocated O

the O
U.S. O

In O
the O
fall O
of O
1949 O
, O
ABC O
found O
itself O
in O
the O
position O
of O
an O
outsider O
, O
with O
less O
coverage O
than O
two O
of O
its O
competing O
networks O
, O
CBS B-KP
and I-KP
NBC I-KP
, O
even O
though O
it O
was O
on O
par O
with O
them O
in O
some O
major O
cities O
and O
had O
a O
headstart O
over O
its O
third O
rival O
at O
the O
time O
, O
the O
DuMont B-KP
Television I-KP
Network I-KP
. O

Before O
the O
freeze O
ended O
in O
1952 O
, O
there O
were O
only O
108 B-KP
existing O
television O
stations O
in O
the O
United O

; O
a O
few O
major O
cities O
( O
such O

had O
only O
two B-KP

many O

) O
did O
not O
yet O
have O
any O

The O
result O
was O
a O
strange O
period O
where O
television O
flourished O
in O
certain O
areas O
and O
network O
radio O
remained O
the O
main O
source O

In O

on O
a O
proposal O
for O

Noble O
received O
other O

one O
from O
CBS O
founder O
William B-KP
S. I-KP
Paley I-KP
; O
however O
, O
a O

at O
the O

Goldenson O
and O
Noble O
reached O
a O
tentative O
agreement O
in O
the O
late O
spring O
of O
1951 O
in O
which O
UPT O

The O

the O

In O

Goldenson O

ABC O

gains O
in O

share O
were O
greatly O
helped O
by O
the O

By O
1954 O
, O
all O
U.S. O

had O
regained O
control O
of O
their O

, O
with O
higher O

However O
that O
year O
, O
ABC O
had O
only O
14 B-KP
primary O
affiliates O
compared O
to O
the O
74 B-KP
that O
carried O
the O
majority O
of O
CBS O
programs O
and O
the O
71 B-KP
that O
were O
primarily O
affiliated O
with O
NBC O
. O

Most O
markets O
outside O
the O
largest O
ones O
were O
not O
large O
enough O
to O
support O
three O
full O

network O
affiliates O
. O

In O
some O
markets O
that O
were O
large O
enough O
for O
a O
third O
full O
time O
affiliate O
, O
the O
only O
available O
commercial O
allocation O
was O
on O
the O
less O
desirable O
UHF O
band O
. O

Until O
the O
All B-KP
Channel I-KP
Receiver I-KP
Act I-KP
( O
passed O
by O
Congress O
in O
1961 O
) O
mandated O
the O
inclusion O
of O
UHF B-KP
tuning I-KP
, O
most O
viewers O
needed O
to O
purchase O
a O
converter O
to O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
UHF O
stations O
, O
and O
the O
signal O
quality O
was O
marginal O
at O
best O
even O
with O
a O
converter O
. O

Additionally O
, O
during O
the O
analog O
television O
era O
, O
UHF O
stations O
were O
not O
adequately O
receivable O
in O
rugged O
terrain O
. O

These O
factors O
made O
many O
prospective O
station O
owners O
skittish O
about O
investing O
in O
a O
UHF O
station O
, O
especially O
one O
that O
would O
have O
had O
to O
take O
on O
an O
affiliation O
with O
a O
weaker O
network O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
the O
largest O
markets O
, O
ABC O
was O
relegated O
to O
secondary O
status O
on O
one O
or O
both O
of O
the O
existing O
stations O
, O
usually O
via O
off O
hours O

( O
a O
notable O
exception O
during O
this O
time O
was O
WKST B-KP

despite O
the O
small O

of O
the O

its O
close O
proximity O
to O
Cleveland O
and O
Pittsburgh O
even O
decades O
before O
the O
city O
's O
economic O
collapse O
) O
. O

According O
to O
Goldenson O
, O
this O
meant O
that O
an O
hour O
of O
ABC O
programming O
reported O
five B-KP
times I-KP
lower I-KP

than O
its O

. O

However O
, O
the O
network O

intake O
of O
money O
at O
the O
time O
would O
allow O
it O
to O
accelerate O
its O
content O
production O
. O

Still O
, O
ABC O

limited O
reach O
would O
continue O
to O
hobble O
it O
for O
the O
next O
two O
decades O
; O
several O
smaller O
markets O
would O
not O
grow O
large O
enough O
to O
support O
a O
full O
time O
ABC O
affiliate O
until O
the O
1960s O
, O
with O
some O
very O
small O
markets O
having O
to O
wait O
as O
late O
as O
the O
1980s B-KP
or I-KP
even I-KP
the I-KP
advent I-KP
of I-KP

The O

As O
Jamukha O

drifted O
apart O
in O
their O

began O
consolidating O
power O
, O

Jamukha O
supported O
the B-KP
traditional I-KP
Mongolian I-KP
aristocracy I-KP

while O

followed O
a O
meritocratic O
method O
, O
and O
attracted O
a O
broader O
, O
though O
lower O
class O
, O
range O
of O
followers O
. O

Due O
to O
his O
earlier O
defeat O
of O
the O
Merkits O
, O
and O
a O
proclamation O
by O
the O
shaman O
Kokochu B-KP
that O
the O
Eternal O
Blue O
Sky O
had O
set O
aside O
the O
world O
for O
Tem O

began O
rising O
to O
power O

In O
1186 B-KP

Tem O

elected O

of O

Mongols O

However O
, O
Jamukha O
, O
threatened O
by O
Tem O
jin O

rapid O
ascent O
, O
quickly O
moved O
to O
stop O
Tem O

ambitions O
. O

In O
1187 B-KP
, O
he O
launched O
an O
attack O
against O
his O
former O
friend O
with O
an O
army O
of O
thirty O
thousand O
troops O
. O

Tem O

hastily O
gathered O
together O
his O

to O
defend O

the O
attack O
, O
but O
he O
was O
decisively O
beaten O
in O
the O
Battle B-KP
of I-KP
Dalan I-KP
Balzhut I-KP

Jamukha O
horrified O
people O
greatly O
and O
harmed O
his O
image O
by O
boiling O
seventy O
young O
male O
captives O
alive O
in O
cauldrons O
, O
alienating O
many O
of O
his O
potential O
followers O
and O
eliciting O
sympathy O
for O
Tem O

. O

Toghrul O
, O
as O
Tem O

patron O
, O
was O
exiled O
to O

Qara B-KP

. I-KP

The O
life O
of O
Tem O
jin O
for O
the O
next O
ten O
years O
is O
very O
unclear O
, O
as O
historical O
records O
are O
mostly O
silent O
on O
that O
period O
. O

As O
an O
incentive O
for O
absolute O
obedience O
and O
following O
his O
rule O
of O
law O
, O
the B-KP
Yassa B-KP
code I-KP
, O
Tem O
jin O
promised O
civilians O
and O
soldiers O
wealth B-KP
from I-KP
future I-KP
possible I-KP
war I-KP
spoils I-KP
. O

As O
he O
defeated O
rival O
tribes O
, O
he O
did O
not O
drive O
away O
enemy O
soldiers O
and O
abandon O
the O
rest O
. O

Instead O
, O
he O
took O
the O
conquered O
tribe O
under O
his B-KP
protection B-KP
and I-KP
integrated I-KP
its I-KP
members I-KP
into I-KP
his I-KP
own I-KP
tribe I-KP
. I-KP

He O
would O
even O
have O
his O
mother O
adopt O
orphans B-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
conquered I-KP
tribe I-KP
, O
bringing O
them O
into O
his O
family O
. O

These O
political B-KP
innovations I-KP
inspired O
great O
loyalty O
among O
the O
conquered O
people O
, O
making O
Tem O
jin O
stronger O
with O
each O
victory O
. O

One O
of O
the O
later O
ruptures O
between O
Toghrul O
and O
Tem O
jin O
was O
Toghrul O
's O
refusal O
to O
give O
his O
daughter O
in O
marriage O
to O
Jochi B-KP
, I-KP
the O
eldest O
son O
of O
Tem O
jin O
, O
a O
sign O
of O
disrespect O
in O
the O
Mongolian O
culture O
. O

This O
act O
led O
to O
the O
split O
between O
both O
factions O
and O
was O
a O
prelude O
to O
war O
. O

Toghrul O
allied O
himself O
with O
Jamukha B-KP
, I-KP
who O
already O
opposed O
Tem O
jin O
's O
forces O
; O
however O
, O
the O
internal O
dispute O
between O
Toghrul O
and O
Jamukha O
, O
plus O
the O
desertion O
of O
a O
number O
of O
their O
allies O
to O
Tem O
jin O
, O
led O
to O
Toghrul O
's O
defeat O
. O

Jamukha B-KP
escaped O
during O
the O
conflict O
. O

This O
defeat O
was O
a O
catalyst O
for O
the O
fall O
and O
eventual O
dissolution O
of O
the B-KP
Keraite B-KP
tribe I-KP
. O

The O
next O
direct O
threat O
to O
Tem O
jin O
was O
the B-KP
Naimans I-KP
( O
Naiman O
Mongols O
) O
, O
with O
whom O
Jamukha O
and O
his O
followers O
took O
refuge O
. O

The O
Naimans O
did O
not O
surrender O
, O
although O
enough O
sectors O
again O
voluntarily O
sided O
with O
Tem O
jin O
. O

In O
1201 B-KP
, O
a O
khuruldai O
elected O
Jamukha O
as O
G O
r O
Khan O
, O
`` O
universal B-KP
ruler I-KP
'' O
, O
a O
title O
used O
by O
the O
rulers O
of O
the O
Qara O
Khitai O
. O

Jamukha O
's O
assumption O
of O
this O
title O
was O
the O
final O
breach O
with O
Tem O
jin O
, O
and O
Jamukha O
formed O
a O
coalition O
of O
tribes O
to O
oppose O
him O
. O

Before O
the O
conflict O
, O
however O
, O
several O
generals O
abandoned O
Jamukha O
, O
including O
Subutai B-KP
, O
Jelme O

well O
known O
younger O
brother O
. O

After O
several O
battles O
, O
Jamukha O
was O
finally O
turned O
over O
to O
Tem O
jin O
by O
his O
own O
men O
in O
1206 B-KP
. O

According O
to O
the O
Secret O
History O
, O
Tem O
jin O
again O
offered O
his B-KP
friendship B-KP
to O
Jamukha O
, O
asking O
him O
to O
return O
to O
his O
side O
. O

Tem O
jin O
had O
killed O
the O
men O
who O
betrayed O
Jamukha O
, O
stating O
that O
he B-KP
did I-KP
not I-KP
want I-KP
disloyal I-KP
men I-KP
in I-KP
his I-KP
army I-KP
. O

Jamukha O
refused O
the O
offer O
of O
friendship O
and O
reunion O
, O
saying O
that O
there O
can O
only O
be O
one O
sun O
in O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
for O
a B-KP
noble I-KP
death I-KP
. I-KP

The O
custom O
is O
to O
die O
without O
spilling O
blood O
, O
which O
is O
granted O
by O
breaking B-KP
the I-KP
back I-KP
. O

Jamukha O
requested O
this O
form O
of O
death O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
the O
past O
Jamukha O
had O
been O
known O
to O
have O
boiled O
his O
opponents O
' O
generals O
alive O
. O

Accounts O
of O

life O
are O
marked O
by O
claims O
of O
a O
series O
of O
betrayals O
and O
conspiracies O

These O
include O
rifts O
with O

problems O
with O
the O

important O

who O
was O
allegedly O
trying O
to O
drive O
a O
wedge O
between O
him O
and O
his O
loyal O
brother O
Khasar B-KP

His O
military O
strategies O
showed O
a O
deep O
interest O
in O
gathering O
good O
intelligence O
and O
understanding B-KP
the I-KP
motivations I-KP
of I-KP
his I-KP
rivals I-KP
, O
exemplified O
by O
his O
extensive O
spy O
network O
and O
Yam B-KP
route I-KP
systems I-KP

He O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
quick O
student O

adopting O

that O
he O
encountered O
, O
such O
as O

from O
the B-KP
Chinese I-KP

He O
was O
also O
ruthless O
, O
demonstrated O
by O
his O
tactic O
of O
measuring O
against O
the O
linchpin O
, O
used O
against O
the O
tribes B-KP
led I-KP
by I-KP
Jamukha I-KP

As O
a O

by O

, O
Uyghurs O
, O

other O

It O
was O
a O
monumental O
feat O
for O
the O
`` O
Mongols O
'' O
( O
as O
they O
became O
known O
collectively O
) O
. O

At O
a O
Khuruldai B-KP

The O

when O

This O

In O
1215 B-KP
Genghis O
besieged O
, O
captured O
, O
and O
sacked O
the O
Jin O
capital O
of O
Zhongdu O
( O
modern O
day O
Beijing O

. O

This O
forced O
the O
Emperor O
Xuanzong O
to O
move O
his O
capital O
south O
to O
Kaifeng B-KP
, I-KP
abandoning O
the O
northern O
half O

Between O
1232 O

Kaifeng O
fell O
to O
the O
Mongols O
under O
the O
reign O
of O
Genghis O

The O
Jin O
dynasty O
collapsed O
in O
1234 O

after O
the O
siege O

Kuchlug B-KP
, O
the O
deposed O
Khan O
of O
the O
Naiman O
confederation O
that O
Tem O

defeated O
and O
folded O
into O
his O
Mongol O
Empire O
, O
fled O
west O
and O
usurped O
the O
khanate O
of O
Qara O
Khitai O
( O
also O
known O
as O
the O
Western O
Liao O
, O
as O
it O
was O
originally O
established O
as O
remnants O
of O
the B-KP
Liao B-KP
dynasty I-KP
) O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
decided O
to O
conquer O
the O
Qara O
Khitai O
and O
defeat O
Kuchlug O
, O
possibly O
to O
take O
him O
out O
of O
power O

By O
this O
time O
the O
Mongol O
army O
was O
exhausted O
from O
ten O
years O
of O
continuous O
campaigning O
in O
China O
against O
the O
Western O
Xia O
and O
Jin O
dynasty O

Therefore O
, O
Genghis O
sent O
only O
two O
tumen O
( O
20,000 B-KP
soldiers O
) O
against O
Kuchlug O
, O
under O
his O
younger O
general O
, O
Jebe B-KP
, O
known O
as O
`` O
The B-KP
Arrow I-KP
'' O
. O

With O
such O
a O
small O
force O
, O
the O
invading O
Mongols O
were O
forced O
to O
change O
strategies O
and O
resort O
to O
inciting B-KP
internal I-KP
revolt I-KP
among I-KP
Kuchlug I-KP
's I-KP
supporters I-KP
, O
leaving O
the O
Qara O
Khitai O
more O
vulnerable O
to O
Mongol O
conquest O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Kuchlug O
's O
army O
was O
defeated O
west B-KP
of I-KP
Kashgar I-KP
. O

Kuchlug O
fled O
again O
, O
but O
was O
soon O
hunted O
down O
by O
Jebe O

army O
and O
executed O
. O

By O
1218 O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
defeat O
of O
Qara O
Khitai O
, O
the O
Mongol O
Empire O
and O
its O
control O
extended O
as O
far O
west O
as O
Lake B-KP
Balkhash I-KP
, I-KP
which O
bordered O
the O
Khwarezmia O
( O
Khwarezmid B-KP
Empire I-KP
) O
, O
a B-KP
Muslim B-KP
state I-KP
that O
reached O
the O
Caspian O
Sea O
to O
the O
west O

Persian O
Gulf O

the O
Arabian O
Sea O
to O
the O
south O
. O

In O
the O
early O
13th O
century O
, O
the O
Khwarazmian O
dynasty O
was O
governed O
by O
Shah B-KP
Ala I-KP
ad I-KP
Din I-KP
Muhammad I-KP
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
saw O
the O
potential O
advantage O
in O
Khwarezmia O
as O
a O
commercial O
trading O
partner O
using O
the B-KP
Silk B-KP
Road I-KP
, O
and O
he O
initially O
sent O
a O
500 O
man O
caravan O
to O
establish O
official O
trade O
ties O
with O
the O
empire O
. O

However O
, O
Inalchuq B-KP
, O
the O
governor O
of O
the O
Khwarezmian O
city O
of O
Otrar O
, O
attacked O
the O
caravan O
that O
came O
from O
Mongolia O
, O
claiming O
that O
the O
caravan O
contained O
spies O
and O
therefore O
was O
a O
conspiracy O
against O
Khwarezmia O
. O

The O
situation O
became O
further O
complicated O
because O
the O
governor O
later O
refused O
to O
make O
repayments O
for O
the O
looting O
of O
the O
caravans O
and O
handing O
over O
the O
perpetrators O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
then O
sent O
again O
a O
second O
group O
of O
three O
ambassadors O
( O
two O
Mongols O
and O
a O
Muslim B-KP
) O
to O
meet O
the O
Shah O
himself O
instead O
of O
the O
governor O
Inalchuq O
. O

The O
Shah O
had O
all O
the O
men O
shaved O
and O
the B-KP
Muslim I-KP
beheaded O
and O
sent O
his O
head O
back O
with O
the O
two O
remaining O
ambassadors O
. O

This O
was O
seen O
as O
an O
affront O
and O
insult O
to O
Genghis O
Khan O
. O

Outraged O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
planned O
one O
of O
his O
largest O
invasion O
campaigns O
by O
organizing O
together O
around O
100,000 B-KP
soldiers I-KP
( O
10 O
tumens O
) O
, O
his O
most O
capable O
generals O
and O
some O
of O
his O
sons O
. O

He O
left O
a O
commander O
and O
number O
of O
troops O
in O
China O
, O
designated O
his O
successors O
to O
be O
his O
family O
members O
and O
likely O
appointed O
gedei O
to O
be O
his O
immediate O
successor O
and O
then O
went O
out O
to O
Khwarezmia O
. O

The O
Mongol O
army O
under O
Genghis O
Khan O
, O
generals O
and O
his O
sons O
crossed O
the O
Tien B-KP
Shan I-KP
mountains O
by O
entering O
the O
area O
controlled O
by O
the O
Khwarezmian O
Empire O
. O

After O
compiling O
intelligence O
from O
many O
sources O
Genghis O
Khan O
carefully O
prepared O
his O
army O
, O
which O
was O
divided O
into O
three B-KP
groups I-KP
. O

His O
son O
Jochi O
led O
the O
first O
division O
into O
the O
northeast O
of O
Khwarezmia O
. O

The O
second O
division O
under O
Jebe O
marched O
secretly O
to O
the B-KP
southeast I-KP
part I-KP
of I-KP
Khwarzemia I-KP
to O
form O
, O
with O
the O
first O
division O
, O
a O
pincer O
attack O
on O
Samarkand B-KP
. O

The O
third O
division O
under O
Genghis B-KP
Khan I-KP
and I-KP
Tolui I-KP
marched O
to O
the O
northwest O
and O
attacked O
Khwarzemia O
from O
that O
direction O
. O

The O
Shah O
's O
army O
was O
split O
by O
diverse O
internecine O
feuds O
and O
by O
the O
Shah O
's O
decision O
to O
divide O
his O
army O
into O
small O
groups O
concentrated O
in O
various O
cities O
. O

This O
fragmentation B-KP
was O
decisive O
in O
Khwarezmia O
's O
defeats O
, O
as O
it O
allowed O
the O
Mongols O
, O
although O
exhausted O
from O
the O
long O
journey O

to O
immediately O
set O
about O
defeating O
small O
fractions O
of O
the O
Khwarzemi O
forces O
instead O
of O
facing O
a O
unified O
defense O
. O

The O
Mongol O
army O
quickly O
seized O
the O
town O
of O
Otrar B-KP
, O
relying O
on O
superior O
strategy O
and O
tactics O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
ordered O
the O
wholesale O
massacre O
of O
many O
of O
the O
civilians O
, O
enslaved O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
population O
and O
executed O
Inalchuq O
by O
pouring O
molten B-KP
silver I-KP
into O
his O
ears O
and O

, O
as O
retribution O
for O
his O
actions O

Near O
the O
end O
of O
the O
battle O
the O
Shah O
fled B-KP
rather O
than O
surrender O

Genghis O
Khan O
ordered O
Subutai B-KP
and I-KP
Jebe I-KP
to O
hunt O
him O
down O
, O
giving O
them O
20,000 O
men O
and O
two O
years O
to O
do O
this O

The O
Shah O
died O
under O
mysterious O
circumstances O

his O
empire O

The O
Mongols O
' O
conquest O

even O
by O

brutal O

After O
the O

Samarkand B-KP
fell O
, O
the O
capital O
was O
moved O
to O
Bukhara B-KP
by O
the O

According O

Genghis O

challenged O
the B-KP
Mongols I-KP
to O
a O
battle O
near O
Helan O
Mountains O
but O
was O
defeated O
. O

In O
November O
, O
Genghis O
laid O
siege O
to O
the O
Tangut O
city O
Lingzhou O
and O
crossed O
the B-KP
Yellow B-KP
River I-KP
, O
defeating O
the O
Tangut O
relief O
army O
. O

According O
to O
legend O
, O
it O
was O
here O
that O
Genghis O
Khan O
reportedly O
saw O
a B-KP
line I-KP
of I-KP
five I-KP
stars I-KP
arranged I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
sky I-KP
and O
interpreted O
it O
as O
an O
omen O
of O
his O
victory O
. O

In O
1227 O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
's O
army O
attacked O
and O
destroyed O
the O
Tangut O
capital O
of O
Ning B-KP
Hia I-KP
and O
continued O
to O
advance O
, O
seizing O
Lintiao O
fu O
, O
Xining O
province O
, O
Xindu O
fu O
, O
and O
Deshun O
province O
in O
quick O
succession O
in O
the O
spring O
. O

At O
Deshun O
, O
the O
Tangut O
general O
Ma B-KP
Jianlong I-KP
put O
up O
a O
fierce O
resistance O
for O
several O
days O
and O
personally O
led O
charges O
against O
the O
invaders O
outside O
the O
city O
gate O
. O

Ma O
Jianlong O
later O
died O
from O
wounds O
received O
from O
arrows B-KP
in O
battle O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
, O
after O
conquering O
Deshun O
, O
went O
to O
Liupanshan B-KP
( O
Qingshui O
County O
, O
Gansu O
Province O
) O
to O
escape O
the O
severe O
summer O
. O

The O
new O
Tangut O
emperor O
quickly O
surrendered O
to O
the O
Mongols O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Tanguts O
officially O
surrendered O
soon O
after O
. O

Not O
happy O
with O
their O
betrayal O
and O
resistance O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
ordered O
the O
entire O
imperial O
family O
to O
be O
executed B-KP
, O
effectively O
ending O
the O
Tangut O
lineage O
. O

The O
succession O
of O
Genghis O
Khan O
was O
already O
a O
significant O
topic O
during O
the O
later O
years O
of O
his O
reign O
, O
as O
he O
reached O
old O
age O
. O

The O
long O
running O
paternity O
discussion O
about O
Genghis O
' O
oldest O
son O
Jochi B-KP
was O
particularly O
contentious O
because O
of O
the O
seniority O
of O
Jochi B-KP
among O
the O
brothers O
. O

According O
to O
traditional O
historical O
accounts O
, O
the O
issue O
over O
Jochi O
's O
paternity O
was O
voiced O
most O
strongly O
by O
Chagatai B-KP
. O

In O
The O
Secret O
History O
of O
the O
Mongols O
, O
just O
before O
the O
invasion B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Khwarezmid I-KP
Empire I-KP
by O
Genghis O
Khan O
, O
Chagatai B-KP
declared O
before O
his O
father O
and O
brothers O
that O
he O
would O
never O
accept O
Jochi O
as O
Genghis O
Khan O
's O
successor O
. O

In O
response O
to O
this O
tension O
, O
and O
possibly O
for O
other O
reasons O
, O
gedei O
was O
appointed O
as O
successor O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
friction O
between O
his O
sons O
( O
particularly O
between O
Chagatai B-KP
and I-KP
Jochi I-KP
) I-KP
and O
worried O
of O
possible O
conflict O
between O
them O
if O
he O
died O
. O

He O
therefore O
decided O
to O
divide O
his O
empire O
among O
his O
sons O
and O
make O
all O
of O
them O
Khan O
in O
their O
own O
right O
, O
while O
appointing O
one O
of O
his O
sons O
as O
his O
successor O
. O

Chagatai B-KP
was O
considered O
unstable O
due O
to O
his O
temper O
and O
rash O
behavior O
, O
because O
of O
statements O
he O
made O
that O
he O
would O
not O
follow O
Jochi O
if O
he O
were O
to O
become O
his O
father O
's O
successor O
. O

Tolui B-KP
, I-KP
Genghis O
Khan O
's O
youngest O
son O
, O
was O
not O
to O
be O
his O
successor O
because O
he O
was O
the O
youngest O
and O
in O
the O
Mongol O
culture O
, O
youngest O
sons O
were O
not O
given O
much O
responsibility O
due O
to O
their O
age O
. O

If O
Jochi O
were O
to O
become O
successor O
, O
it O
was O
likely O
that O
Chagatai O
would O
engage O
in O
warfare O
with O
him O
and O
collapse O
the O
empire O
. O

Therefore O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
decided O
to O
give O
the O
throne O
to O
gedei O
. O

gedei O
was O
seen O
by O
Genghis O
Khan O
as O
dependable O
in O
character O
and O
relatively O
stable O
and O
down O
to O
earth O
and O
would O
be O
a O
neutral O
candidate O
and O
might O
defuse O
the O
situation O
between O
his O
brothers O
. O

Jochi O
died O
in O
1226 B-KP
, O
during O
his O
father O
's O
lifetime O
. O

Some O
scholars O
, O
notably O
Ratchnevsky O
, O
have O
commented O
on O
the O
possibility O
that O
Jochi O
was O
secretly O
poisoned O
by O
an O
order O
from O
Genghis O
Khan O
. O

Rashid O
al O
Din O
reports O
that O
the O
great O
Khan O
sent O
for O
his O
sons O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1223 O
, O
and O
while O
his O
brothers O
heeded O
the O
order O
, O
Jochi O
remained O
in O
Khorasan B-KP
. O

Juzjani O
suggests O
that O
the O
disagreement O
arose O
from O
a O
quarrel O
between O
Jochi O
and O
his O
brothers O
in O
the O
siege O
of O
Urgench B-KP
. O

Jochi O
had O
attempted O
to O
protect O
Urgench B-KP
from O
destruction O
, O
as O
it O
belonged O
to O
territory O
allocated O
to O
him O
as O
a O
fief O
. O

He O
concludes O
his O
story O
with O
the O
clearly O
apocryphal O
statement O
by O
Jochi O
: O
`` O
Genghis O
Khan O
is O
mad O
to O
have O
massacred O
so O
many O
people O
and O
laid O
waste O
so O
many O
lands O
. O

I O
would O
be O
doing O
a O
service O
if O
I O
killed O
my O
father O
when O
he O
is O
hunting O
, O
made O
an O
alliance O
with O
Sultan B-KP
Muhammad I-KP
, O
brought O
this O
land O
to O
life O
and O
gave O
assistance O
and O
support O
to O
the O
Muslims O
. O
'' O

Juzjani O
claims O
that O
it O
was O
in O
response O
to O
hearing O
of O
these O
plans O
that O
Genghis O
Khan O
ordered O
his O
son O
secretly O
poisoned O
; O
however O
, O
as O
Sultan B-KP
Muhammad I-KP
was I-KP
already I-KP
dead I-KP
in I-KP
1223 I-KP
, I-KP
the O
accuracy O
of O
this O
story O
is O
questionable O
. O

In O
August O
1227 O
, O
during O
the O
fall O
of O
Yinchuan B-KP
, O
the O
capital O
of O
Western O
Xia O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
died O
. O

The O
exact O
cause O
of O
his O
death O
remains O
a O
mystery O
, O
and O
is O
variously O
attributed O
to O
being O
killed O
in O
action O
against O
the O
Western O
Xia O
, O
illness O
, O
falling O
from O
his O
horse O
, O
or O
wounds O
sustained O
in O
hunting O
or O
battle O

According O
to O
The O
Secret O
History O
of O
the O
Mongols O
Genghis O
Khan O
fell O
from O
his O
horse O
while O
hunting B-KP

died O
because O
of O
the O
injury O
. O

He O
was O
already O
old O
and O
tired O
from O
his O
journeys O
. O

The O
Galician O
Volhynian O
Chronicle O
alleges O
he O
was O
killed O
by O
the O
Western O
Xia O
in O
battle O
, O
while O
Marco O
Polo O
wrote O
that O
he O
died O
after O
the O
infection O
of O
an O
arrow B-KP
wound I-KP
he O
received O
during O
his O
final O
campaign O

Later O
Mongol O
chronicles O
connect O
Genghis O
' O
death O
with O
a O
Western B-KP
Xia I-KP
princess O
taken O
as O
war O
booty O
. O

One O
chronicle O
from O
the O
early O
17th O
century O
even O
relates O
the O
legend O
that O
the O
princess O
hid O
a O
small O
dagger O
and O
stabbed O
him O
, O
though O
some O
Mongol O
authors O
have O
doubted O
this O
version O
and O
suspected O
it O
to O
be O
an O
invention O
by O
the O
rival O
Oirads B-KP
. O

Years O
before O
his O
death O
, O
Genghis O
Khan O
asked O
to O
be O
buried B-KP
without I-KP
markings I-KP
, O
according O
to O
the O
customs O
of O
his O
tribe O
. O

After O
he O
died O
, O
his O
body O
was O
returned O
to O
Mongolia O

presumably O
to O
his O
birthplace O
in O
Khentii B-KP

buried O
somewhere O
close O

the O
Burkhan O
Khaldun O

what O

Genghis O

which O
raises O
the O
possibility O
of O
actually O
locating O
the O

long O

Folklore O
says O
that O
a B-KP
river B-KP
was O
diverted O
over O
his O
grave O
to O
make O
it O
impossible O
to O
find O
( O
the O

that O
trees O

The O
Mongol O
Empire O
was O
governed O
by O
a O
civilian O
and O
military O
code O
, O
called O
the O
Yassa B-KP
, O
created O
by O
Genghis B-KP
Khan I-KP

The O
Mongol O
Empire O
did O
not O
emphasize O
the O
importance O
of O
ethnicity O
and O
race O
in O
the O
administrative O
realm O
, O
instead O
adopting O
an O
approach O
grounded O
in O
meritocracy B-KP

The O
exception O
was O
the O
role O
of O
Genghis B-KP
Khan I-KP

his I-KP
family I-KP

The O
Mongol O
Empire O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
ethnically O

culturally O
diverse O
empires O
in O
history O
, O
as O

Many O
of O

considered O
themselves O
Mongols O

civilian O
life O

included O

, O
to O
some O
extent O
, O
teachers O

. O

The O
Mongol O
Empire O
practiced O
religious O
tolerance O
because O
Mongol O
tradition O
had O
long O
held O
that O
religion O
was O
a B-KP
personal I-KP
concept I-KP

Modern O

historians O

that O
towards O

Genghis O

attempted O
to O
create O

of O
the O
lifting O
of O
discriminatory O
policies O

the B-KP
Chinese B-KP

Women O
played O
a O
relatively O
important O
role O

Mongol O

the O
Mongol O

Modern O

refer O

the O
alleged O
policy O

encouraging O
trade O

the B-KP
Pax B-KP
Mongolica I-KP

Genghis O
Khan O
realised O
that O
he O
needed O
people O
who O
could O
govern O
cities O
and O
states O
conquered O
by O
him O
. O

He O
also O
realised O
that O
such O
administrators O
could O
not O
be O
found O
among O
his O
Mongol O
people O
because O
they B-KP
were I-KP
nomads B-KP
and I-KP
thus I-KP
had I-KP
no I-KP
experience I-KP
governing I-KP
cities I-KP
. O

For O
this O
purpose O
Genghis O
Khan O
invited O
a O
Khitan O
prince O
, O
Chu'Tsai B-KP
, I-KP
who O
worked O
for O
the O
Jin O
and O
had O
been O
captured O
by O
the O
Mongol O
army O
after O
the O
Jin B-KP
dynasty I-KP
was O
defeated O
. O

Jin B-KP
had O
captured O
power O
by O
displacing O
Khitan O
. O

Genghis O
told O
Chu'Tsai O
, O
who O
was O
a O
lineal O
descendant O
of O
Khitan B-KP
rulers I-KP
, I-KP
that O
he O
had O
avenged O
Chu'Tsai O
's O
forefathers O
. O

Chu'Tsai O
responded O
that O
his O
father O
served O
the O
Jin O
dynasty O
honestly O
and O
so O
did O
he O
; O
also O
he O
did O
not O
consider O
his O
own O
father O
his O
enemy O
, O
so O
the O
question O
of O
revenge O
did O
not O
apply O
. O

This O
reply O
impressed O
Genghis O
Khan O
. O

Chu'Tsai O
administered O
parts O
of O
the O
Mongol O
Empire O
and O
became O
a O
confidant O
of O
the O
successive O
Mongol O
Khans O
. O

Genghis O
Khan O
put O
absolute O
trust O

his B-KP
generals I-KP

such O
as O
Muqali B-KP

In O
Turkey B-KP
, I-KP
Genghis O

is O
looked O
on O

In O
the O
early O
1990s B-KP
the O
memory O
of O
Genghis O
Khan O
with O
the O
Mongolian O
national O
identity O
has O
had O
a O
powerful O
revival O
partly O
because O
of O
his O
perception O
during O
the O
Mongolian O
People O

Genghis O
Khan O
became O
one O
of O
the O
central O
figures O
of O

He O
is O
looked O
upon O
positively O
by O
Mongolians O
for O
his O
role O
in O
uniting B-KP

For O
example O

it O
is O

for O
Mongolians O
to O
refer O
to O
their O

especially O
among O

However O
, O
there O
is O
a O
chasm O
in O
the O
perception O
of O
his B-KP
brutality I-KP

Mongolians O
maintain O
that O
the O
historical O
records O
written O
by O
non O
Mongolians O
are O
unfairly B-KP
biased I-KP
against O
Genghis O

that O
his B-KP

community O

pharmacists I-KP

provide I-KP
consulting I-KP
services I-KP

Since O
about B-KP
the I-KP
year I-KP
2000 B-KP
, O
a O
growing O
number O
of O
Internet O
pharmacies O
have O
been O
established O
worldwide O
. O

Many O
of O
these O
pharmacies O
are O
similar O
to O
community O
pharmacies O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
, O
many O
of O
them O
are O
actually O
operated O
by O
brick B-KP

mortar I-KP
community I-KP
pharmacies I-KP
that I-KP
serve I-KP
consumers I-KP
online I-KP
and I-KP
those I-KP
that I-KP
walk I-KP
in I-KP
their I-KP
door I-KP
. O

The O
primary O
difference O
is O
the B-KP
method I-KP
by I-KP
which I-KP
the I-KP
medications I-KP
are I-KP
requested I-KP
and I-KP
received I-KP
. O

Some O
customers O
consider O
this O
to O
be O
more B-KP
convenient I-KP
and I-KP
private I-KP
method I-KP
rather O
than O
traveling O
to O
a O
community O
drugstore O
where O
another B-KP
customer I-KP
might I-KP
overhear I-KP
about I-KP
the I-KP
drugs I-KP
that I-KP
they I-KP
take I-KP
. O

Internet O
pharmacies O
( O
also O
known O
as O
online B-KP
pharmacies I-KP
) O
are O
also O
recommended O
to O
some O
patients O
by O
their O
physicians O
if O
they O
are O
homebound B-KP
. O

While O
most O
Internet O
pharmacies O
sell B-KP
prescription I-KP
drugs I-KP
and I-KP
require I-KP
a I-KP
valid I-KP
prescription I-KP
, O
some B-KP
Internet I-KP
pharmacies I-KP
sell I-KP
prescription I-KP
drugs I-KP
without I-KP
requiring I-KP
a I-KP
prescription I-KP
. O

Many O
customers O
order O
drugs O
from O
such O
pharmacies O
to B-KP
avoid B-KP
the I-KP
`` I-KP
inconvenience I-KP
'' I-KP
of I-KP
visiting I-KP
a I-KP
doctor I-KP
or I-KP
to I-KP
obtain I-KP
medications I-KP
which I-KP
their I-KP
doctors I-KP
were I-KP
unwilling I-KP
to I-KP
prescribe I-KP
. O

However O
, O
this O
practice O
has O
been O
criticized O
as O
potentially B-KP
dangerous I-KP
, O
especially O
by B-KP
those B-KP
who I-KP
feel I-KP
that I-KP
only I-KP
doctors I-KP
can I-KP
reliably I-KP
assess I-KP
contraindications I-KP
, I-KP
risk/benefit I-KP
ratios I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
an I-KP
individual I-KP

overall I-KP
suitability I-KP
for I-KP
use I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP

There O
also O
have O
been O
reports B-KP
of I-KP
such I-KP
pharmacies I-KP
dispensing I-KP
substandard I-KP
products I-KP
. O

Of O
particular O
concern O
with O
Internet O
pharmacies O
is O
the B-KP
ease I-KP
with I-KP
which I-KP
people I-KP
, I-KP

The O
reason O
for O
the O

the B-KP
high B-KP

and O
in O
exaggerating B-KP
their I-KP
seriousness I-KP
, O
because B-KP
he I-KP
or I-KP
she I-KP
can I-KP
then I-KP
sell I-KP
more I-KP
medications I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
patient I-KP
. O

Such O
self O
interest O
directly O
conflicts O
with O
the O
patient O

interest O
in B-KP
obtaining B-KP
cost I-KP
effective I-KP

In O

The O
immune O
system O
protects O
organisms O
from O
infection O
with O
layered O
defenses O
of O

specificity O
. O

In O
simple O
terms O
, O
physical B-KP
barriers I-KP
prevent O
pathogens O
such O
as O
bacteria O

viruses O
from O
entering O
the O
organism O
. O

If O
a O
pathogen O
breaches O
these O
barriers O
, O
the B-KP
innate I-KP
immune I-KP
system I-KP
provides O
an O
immediate O

. O

Innate B-KP

found O
in O
all O

If O
pathogens O
successfully O
evade O
the O
innate O

, O
vertebrates O
possess O
a O

, O
the B-KP
adaptive I-KP
immune I-KP
system I-KP
, O
which O
is O
activated O
by O
the O

Here O
, O
the O
immune O
system O
adapts O
its O
response O
during O
an O
infection O
to O
improve O
its O
recognition O
of O
the O

This O
improved O

is O
then O
retained O
after O
the O
pathogen O
has O
been O
eliminated O
, O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
immunological B-KP

allows O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
to O
mount O
faster O

stronger O
attacks O
each O
time O
this O

Both O
innate O

depend O
on O
the O
ability O

the O
immune O
system O
to O
distinguish O
between O

Inflammation B-KP
is O
one O
of O
the O
first O
responses O
of O
the O
immune O
system O

The O
symptoms O
of O
inflammation O
are O
redness O

and O
pain O
, O
which O
are O
caused O
by O
increased B-KP
blood I-KP
flow I-KP
into I-KP
tissue I-KP
. O

Inflammation O
is O
produced O
by O
eicosanoids B-KP
and I-KP
cytokines I-KP
, O
which O
are O
released O
by O
injured O
or O
infected O
cells O
. O

Eicosanoids O
include O
prostaglandins B-KP
that O
produce O
fever O
and O
the O
dilation O
of O

associated O
with O
inflammation O
, O
and O
leukotrienes O
that O
attract O
certain O
white O

cells O
( O
leukocytes O
) O
. O

Common O
cytokines O
include O
interleukins B-KP
that O
are O
responsible O
for O
communication O
between O
white O

; O
chemokines O
that O
promote O
chemotaxis O

These O
cytokines O

other O
chemicals O
recruit O
immune O

Phagocytosis O
is O
an O
important O
feature O
of O
cellular O
innate O
immunity O
performed O
by O
cells O
called O
'phagocytes O
' O
that O
engulf O

Phagocytes O
generally O
patrol O
the O
body O
searching O
for O
pathogens O
, O
but O
can O
be O
called O
to O
specific O
locations O
by O
cytokines B-KP

Once O
a O
pathogen O
has O
been O
engulfed O
by O
a O
phagocyte O
, O
it O
becomes O
trapped O
in O
an O
intracellular O
vesicle O
called O
a O
phagosome B-KP
, O
which O
subsequently O
fuses O
with O
another O
vesicle O
called O
a O
lysosome O
to O
form O
a O
phagolysosome B-KP
. O

The O
pathogen O
is O
killed O
by O
the O
activity O
of O
digestive O
enzymes O
or O
following O
a O
respiratory O
burst O
that O
releases O
free O

into O
the O
phagolysosome B-KP
. O

Phagocytosis O
evolved O
as O
a O
means O
of O
acquiring B-KP
nutrients I-KP
, O
but O
this O
role O
was O
extended O
in O
phagocytes O
to O
include O
engulfment O
of O
pathogens O
as O
a O
defense O
mechanism O
. O

Phagocytosis O
probably O
represents O
the O
oldest O
form O
of O
host O
defense O
, O
as O
phagocytes O
have O
been O
identified O
in O
both O
vertebrate O
and O
invertebrate O
animals O
. O

Neutrophils B-KP
and I-KP
macrophages I-KP
are O
phagocytes O
that O
travel O
throughout O
the O
body O
in O
pursuit O
of O
invading O
pathogens O
. O

Neutrophils B-KP
are O
normally O
found O
in O
the O

particularly O
as O
a O
result O

, O
neutrophils O
migrate O
toward O
the O
site O

in O
a O
process O

are O
usually O
the O
first O
cells O

They O
were O
named O

of O
the O
initial O

For O
many O

how O

It O
is O
now O
known O
that O
the O

recognized O
by O
killer B-KP

The O

requires O
the O

during O
a O
process O

The O

Should O

These O
two O
mechanisms O

reflect O
the O
different O
roles O
of O
the O
two O
types O
of O
T O

A O
third O

are O
the O
T O

Killer B-KP
T I-KP

are O
a O
sub O

of O
T O

As O
with O
B O
cells O
, O
each O
type O
of O
T O
cell O
recognizes O
a O
different O
antigen O

Killer O
T O
cells O
are O
activated O
when O
their O
T B-KP
cell I-KP
receptor I-KP
( I-KP

this O
specific O
antigen O
in O
a O
complex O
with O
the O
MHC O
Class O
I O
receptor O
of O
another O
cell O
. O

Recognition O
of O
this O
MHC O

antigen O
complex O
is O
aided O
by O
a O
co O
receptor O
on O
the O
T O
cell O
, O
called O
CD8 B-KP

The O
T O

then O
travels O
throughout O
the O
body O
in O
search O
of O
cells O
where O
the O
MHC O

bear O
this O
antigen O
. O

When O
an O
activated O
T O
cell O
contacts O
such O
cells O
, O
it O
releases O
cytotoxins O
, O
such O
as O
perforin B-KP

the O

, O
allowing O

enter O
. O

The O
entry O
of O
another O
toxin O
called O
granulysin B-KP
( I-KP
a I-KP

induces O
the O

T O
cell O
activation O
is O
tightly O
controlled O
and O
generally O
requires O
a O
very O

or O
additional O
activation O

provided O
by O
`` O

The O

is O
also O
recognized O
by O
the O

for O
the O

Helper O
T O

have O
a O
weaker O

with O
the O

a B-KP

Helper O
T O

The O
activation O

causes O
it O

influence O
the O

A B-KP
B I-KP
cell I-KP
identifies O
pathogens O
when O
antibodies O
on O
its O
surface O
bind O
to O
a O
specific O
foreign O
antigen O
. O

This O
antigen/antibody O
complex O
is O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
B O
cell O
and O
processed O
by O
proteolysis B-KP
into O
peptides O
. O

The O
B O
cell O
then O
displays O
these O
antigenic O
peptides O
on O
its O
surface O
MHC O
class O
II O
molecules O
. O

This O
combination O
of O
MHC O
and O
antigen O
attracts O
a O
matching O
helper O
T O
cell O
, O
which O
releases O
lymphokines B-KP
and O
activates O
the O
B O
cell O
. O

As O
the O
activated O
B O
cell O
then O
begins O
to O
divide O
, O
its O
offspring O
( O
plasma O
cells O
) O
secrete O
millions O
of O
copies O
of O
the O
antibody O
that O
recognizes O
this O
antigen O
. O

These O
antibodies O
circulate O
in O
blood O
plasma O
and O
lymph O
, O
bind O
to O
pathogens O
expressing O
the O
antigen O
and O
mark O
them O
for O
destruction O
by O
complement O
activation O
or O
for O
uptake O
and O
destruction O
by O
phagocytes O
. O

Antibodies O
can O
also O
neutralize O
challenges O
directly O
, O
by O
binding O
to O
bacterial O
toxins O
or O
by O
interfering O
with O
the O
receptors O
that O
viruses O
and O
bacteria O
use O
to O
infect O
cells O
. O

When O
B O
cells O
and O
T O
cells O
are O
activated O
and O
begin O
to O
replicate O
, O
some O
of O
their O
offspring O
become O
long B-KP
lived I-KP
memory I-KP
cells I-KP
. O

Throughout O
the O
lifetime O
of O
an O
animal O
, O
these O
memory O
cells O
remember O
each B-KP
specific I-KP
pathogen I-KP
encountered O
and O
can O
mount O
a O
strong B-KP
response I-KP
if O
the O
pathogen O
is O
detected O
again O
. O

This O
is O
`` O
adaptive B-KP
'' O
because O
it O
occurs O
during O
the O
lifetime O
of O
an O
individual O
as O
an O
adaptation O
to O
infection O
with O
that O
pathogen O
and O
prepares O
the O
immune O
system O
for O
future O
challenges O
. O

Immunological O
memory O
can O
be O
in O
the O
form O
of O
either O
passive B-KP

or I-KP
active I-KP
long I-KP

. O

Newborn O

have O
no O
prior O

particularly O
vulnerable O

Several O
layers O
of O

provided O
by O
the O

During O
pregnancy O
, O
a O
particular O
type O
of O
antibody O
, O
called O
IgG B-KP
, O
is O
transported O
from O
mother O
to O
baby O
directly O
across O
the O
placenta O
, O
so O
human O
babies O
have O
high O
levels O
of O
antibodies O
even O
at O
birth O
, O
with O
the O
same O
range O
of O
antigen O
specificities O
as O
their O
mother O
. O

Breast B-KP
milk I-KP
or I-KP
colostrum I-KP
also O
contains O
antibodies O
that O
are O
transferred O
to O
the O
gut O
of O
the O
infant O
and O
protect O
against O
bacterial O
infections O
until O
the O
newborn O
can O
synthesize O
its O
own O
antibodies O
. O

This O
is O
passive O
immunity O
because O
the O
fetus O
does O
not O
actually O
make O
any O
memory O
cells O
or O
antibodies O
it O
only O
borrows O
them O
. O

This O
passive B-KP
immunity I-KP
is O
usually O
short O

, O
lasting O
from O
a O
few O
days O
up O
to O
several O
months O
. O

In O
medicine O
, O
protective O

can O
also O
be O
transferred O
artificially O
from O
one O

via O
antibody O

Hormones O
can O
act O
as O
immunomodulators B-KP

altering O
the O

of O
the O

For O
example O
, O
female O

hormones O
are O
known O
immunostimulators O
of O
both B-KP

Some O
autoimmune O
diseases O
such O
as O
lupus B-KP

strike O
women O
preferentially O

By O
contrast O
, O
male O
sex O
hormones O
such O
as O

seem O
to O
be O
immunosuppressive B-KP

Other O

appear O
to O
regulate O
the O
immune O
system O
as O
well O
, O
most O
notably O
prolactin O

and O
vitamin O
D O
. O

When O
suffering O
from O
sleep B-KP

, O
active O
immunizations O
may O
have O
a O
diminished O
effect O

result O
in O

and O
a O

be O
noted O
in O
a O

Additionally O

shown O
to O
be O
closely O

with O
both O

through O

As O
a O
result O
, O
these O

can O
lead O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
chronic O
conditions O
such O
as O
heart B-KP

It O
is O
conjectured O
that O
a O
progressive O
decline B-KP
in I-KP
hormone I-KP
levels I-KP
with I-KP
age I-KP
is O
partially O
responsible O
for O
weakened O

Conversely O
, O
some O
hormones B-KP
are O
regulated O
by O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
notably O
thyroid O
hormone O

. O

The O
age O
related O
decline O
in O
immune O
function O
is O
also O
related O
to O

in O
the O

As O
people O
age O
, O
two O
things O
happen O
that O
negatively O
affect O
their O
vitamin O

levels O
. O

First O
, O
they O
stay O
indoors O
more O
due O
to O
decreased O

levels O
. O

This O
means O
that O
they O
get O
less O
sun O
and O
therefore O
produce O
less O
cholecalciferol B-KP
via O
UVB O
radiation O
. O

Second O
, O
as O
a O
person O
ages O
the O
skin O
becomes O
less O

The O
main O
response O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
to O
tumors O
is O
to O
destroy O
the O

using O
killer B-KP
T I-KP
cells I-KP
, O
sometimes O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O

Tumor O

are O
presented O
on O
MHC O
class O
I O
molecules O
in O
a O
similar O
way O
to O
viral B-KP
antigens I-KP
. O

This O
allows O
killer O
T O
cells O
to O
recognize O
the O
tumor O
cell O
as O
abnormal O
. O

NK O
cells O
also O
kill O
tumorous O
cells O
in O
a O
similar O
way O
, O
especially O
if O
the O
tumor O
cells O
have O
fewer O
MHC B-KP

I I-KP

on O
their O

normal O
; O
this O
is O
a O
common O
phenomenon O
with O

Sometimes O
antibodies B-KP

generated O
against O
tumor O

Unlike O
animals O

Active O
immunity O
can O

artificially O

through O
vaccination B-KP

The O
principle O
behind O
vaccination O
( O
also O
called O
immunization B-KP
) O
is O
to O
introduce O
an B-KP
antigen B-KP
from I-KP
a I-KP
pathogen I-KP
in O
order O
to O
stimulate O
the O
immune O
system O

develop O
specific O
immunity O
against O
that O
particular O
pathogen O
without O
causing O
disease O
associated O
with O
that O
organism O
. O

This O
deliberate O
induction O
of O
an O
immune O
response O
is O
successful O
because O
it O
exploits O
the B-KP
natural I-KP
specificity I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
immune I-KP
system I-KP

as O

as O
its O
inducibility O

With O

of O
the O

vaccination O
represents O
the O
most O
effective O
manipulation O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
mankind O
has O
developed O

The O
success O
of O
any O
pathogen O
depends O
on O
its O
ability B-KP
to I-KP
elude I-KP
host I-KP
immune I-KP
responses I-KP
. O

Therefore O
, O
pathogens O
evolved O
several O
methods O
that O
allow O
them O
to O
successfully O
infect O
a O
host O
, O
while O
evading O
detection O
or O
destruction O
by O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

Bacteria O
often O
overcome O
physical O
barriers O
by O
secreting O
enzymes B-KP
that O
digest O
the O
barrier O
, O
for O
example O
, O
by O
using O
a O
type O
II O

Alternatively O
, O
using O

, O
they O
may O
insert O
a O
hollow O

, O
providing O
a O
direct O
route O
for O
proteins O
to O
move O
from O
the O
pathogen O
to O
the O
host O
. O

These O
proteins O
are O
often O
used O
to O
shut B-KP
down I-KP

In O
the O
mid O
1950s O
, O
Frank B-KP
Burnet I-KP
, O
inspired O
by O
a O
suggestion O
made O
by O
Niels B-KP
Jerne I-KP
, O
formulated O
the O
clonal O
selection O
theory O
( O
CST O
) O
of O
immunity O
. O

On O
the O
basis O
of O
CST O
, O
Burnet O
developed O
a O
theory O
of O
how O
an O
immune O
response O
is O
triggered O
according O
to O
the O
self/nonself O
distinction O
: O
`` O
self O
'' O
constituents O
( O
constituents O
of O
the O

) O
do O
not O
trigger O
destructive O
immune O
responses O
, O
while O
`` O
nonself O
'' O
entities O
( O
pathogens B-KP
, I-KP
an I-KP

) O
trigger O
a O
destructive O
immune O

. O

The O
theory O
was O
later O
modified O

new O
discoveries O
regarding O

the O
complex O
`` O

The O
self/nonself O
theory O
of O
immunity O
and O
the O
self/nonself O
vocabulary O
have O
been O
criticized O
, O
but O
remain O
very O
influential O
. O

Anti O
inflammatory O
drugs O
are O
often O
used O
to O
control O
the O

Glucocorticoids B-KP

the O
most O
powerful O
of O
these O
drugs O

these O

can O
have O
many O
undesirable O
side O
effects O
, O
such O
as O
central O
obesity O

, O
and O
their O
use O

be O
tightly O

. O

Lower O
doses O
of O
anti O

drugs O
are O
often O
used O
in O

with O
cytotoxic B-KP

immunosuppressive I-KP
drugs I-KP
such O
as O
methotrexate B-KP

Cytotoxic B-KP
drugs I-KP
inhibit O
the O

by O
killing O

However O
, O
the O

Second O
, O
inflammation O
may O
occur O
during O

due O
to O
the O

Inflammation O
causes O
a O
great O
deal O

the O

it O
extends B-KP

This O

experimental O

Many O
theories O

from O
the O

The O
end O

the O
19th O

saw O
a O
battle O
between O
`` O
cellular O
'' O
and O
`` O
humoral O
'' O
theories O
of O
immunity O
. O

According O
to O
the O
cellular O
theory O
of O
immunity O
, O
represented O
in O
particular O
by O
Elie B-KP
Metchnikoff I-KP
, O
it O
was O
cells O
more O
precisely O
, O
phagocytes B-KP
that O
were O
responsible O
for O
immune O

. O

In O
contrast O
, O
the O
humoral O
theory O
of O
immunity O
, O
held O
, O
among O
others O
, O
by O
Robert B-KP
Koch I-KP
and I-KP
Emil I-KP
von I-KP
Behring I-KP
, I-KP
stated O
that O
the O
active O

agents O
were O
soluble B-KP
components I-KP
( I-KP
molecules I-KP
) I-KP
found O
in O
the O
organism O
s O
humors O
rather O
than O
its O
cells O
. O

Clearly O
, O
some O
tumors O
evade O
the O
immune O
system O
and O
go O
on O
to O
become O
cancers B-KP
. O

Tumor O
cells O
often O
have O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O
MHC B-KP
class I-KP
I I-KP
molecules I-KP
on O
their O
surface O
, O
thus O
avoiding O
detection O
by O
killer O
T O
cells O
. O

Some O
tumor O
cells O
also O
release O
products O
that O
inhibit O
the O
immune O
response O
; O
for O
example O
by O
secreting O
the O
cytokine B-KP
TGF I-KP
, O
which O
suppresses O
the O
activity O
of O
macrophages B-KP
and I-KP
lymphocytes I-KP
. O

In O
addition O
, O
immunological O
tolerance O
may O
develop O
against O
tumor O

so O
the O
immune O
system O
no O

attacks O

Type O
I O
hypersensitivity O
is O

which O
triggers O
degranulation O

evasion O
strategy O
used O
by O
several O
pathogens O
to O
avoid O
the O
innate O
immune O
system O
is O
to O
hide O
within O
the O
cells O
of O
their O
host O
( O
also O
called O
intracellular B-KP
pathogenesis I-KP
) O
. O

Here O
, O
a O
pathogen O
spends O
most O
of O
its O
life O
cycle O
inside O
host O
cells O
, O
where O
it O
is O
shielded O
from O
direct O
contact O
with O
immune O
cells O
, O
antibodies O
and O
complement O
. O

Some O
examples O
of O
intracellular O
pathogens O
include O
viruses O
, O
the O
food O
poisoning O
bacterium O
Salmonella B-KP
and O
the O
eukaryotic O
parasites O
that O
cause O
malaria O
( O
Plasmodium B-KP
falciparum I-KP
) O
and O
leishmaniasis O
( O
Leishmania O
spp O
. O
) O
. O

Other O
bacteria O
, O
such O
as O
Mycobacterium B-KP
tuberculosis I-KP
, O
live O
inside O
a O
protective O
capsule O
that O
prevents O
lysis O
by O
complement O
. O

Many O
pathogens O
secrete O
compounds O
that O
diminish O
or O
misdirect O
the O
host O
's O
immune O
response O
. O

Some O
bacteria O
form O
biofilms O
to O
protect O
themselves O
from O
the O
cells O
and O
proteins O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

Such O
biofilms O
are O
present O
in O
many O
successful O
infections O
, O
e.g. O
, O
the O
chronic O
Pseudomonas O
aeruginosa O
and O
Burkholderia O
cenocepacia O
infections O
characteristic O
of O
cystic O
fibrosis O
. O

Other O
bacteria O
generate O
surface O
proteins O
that O
bind O
to O
antibodies O
, O
rendering O
them O
ineffective O
; O
examples O
include O
Streptococcus B-KP
( I-KP
protein I-KP
G I-KP
) I-KP
, O
Staphylococcus O
aureus O
( O
protein B-KP
A I-KP
) O
, O
and O
Peptostreptococcus O
magnus O
( O
protein O
L O
) O
. O

The O
mechanisms O
used O
to O
evade O
the O
adaptive O
immune O
system O
are O
more O
complicated O
. O

The O
simplest O
approach O
is O
to O
rapidly O
change O
non O
essential O
epitopes O
( O
amino O
acids O
and/or O
sugars O
) O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
pathogen O
, O
while O
keeping O
essential O
epitopes O
concealed O
. O

This O
is O
called O
antigenic B-KP
variation I-KP
. O

An O
example O
is O
HIV B-KP
, O
which O
mutates O
rapidly O
, O
so O
the O
proteins O
on O
its O
viral O
envelope O
that O
are O
essential O
for O
entry O
into O
its O
host O
target O
cell O
are O
constantly O
changing O
. O

These O
frequent O
changes O
in O
antigens O
may O
explain O
the O
failures O
of O
vaccines O
directed O
at O
this O
virus O
. O

The O
parasite O
Trypanosoma B-KP
brucei I-KP
uses O
a O
similar O
strategy O
, O
constantly O
switching O
one O
type O
of O
surface O
protein O
for O
another O
, O
allowing O
it O
to O
stay O
one O
step O
ahead O
of O
the O
antibody O
response O
. O

Masking O
antigens B-KP
with O
host O
molecules O
is O
another O
common O
strategy O
for O
avoiding O
detection O
by O
the O
immune O
system O
. O

In O
HIV O
, O
the O
envelope O
that O
covers O
the O
virion O
is O
formed O
from O
the O
outermost O
membrane O
of O
the O
host O
cell O
; O
such O
`` O
self O
cloaked O
'' O
viruses O
make O
it O
difficult O
for O
the O
immune O
system O
to O
identify O
them O
as O
`` O
non O
self O
'' O
structures O
. O

Another O
important O
role O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
is O
to O
identify O
and O
eliminate O
tumors O
. O

This O
is O
called O
immune B-KP
surveillance I-KP
. O

The O
transformed O
cells O
of O
tumors O
express O
antigens O
that O
are O
not O
found O
on O
normal O
cells O
. O

To O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
these O
antigens O
appear O
foreign O
, O
and O
their O
presence O
causes O
immune O
cells O
to O
attack O
the O
transformed O
tumor O
cells O
. O

The O
antigens O
expressed O
by O
tumors O
have O
several O
sources O
; O
some O
are O
derived O
from O
oncogenic O
viruses O
like O
human B-KP
papillomavirus I-KP
, O
which O
causes O
cervical O
cancer O
, O
while O
others O
are O
the O
organism O
's O
own O
proteins O
that O
occur O
at O
low O
levels O
in O
normal O
cells O
but O
reach O
high O
levels O
in O
tumor O
cells O
. O

One O
example O
is O
an O
enzyme O
called O
tyrosinase B-KP
that O
, O
when O
expressed O
at O
high O
levels O
, O
transforms O
certain O
skin O
cells O
( O
e.g O
. O

melanocytes B-KP
) O
into O
tumors O
called O
melanomas B-KP
. O

A O
third O
possible O
source O
of O
tumor O
antigens O
are O
proteins O
normally O
important O
for O
regulating O
cell O
growth O
and O
survival O
, O
that O
commonly O
mutate O
into O
cancer O
inducing O
molecules O
called O
oncogenes O
. O

Larger O
drugs O
( O
> B-KP
500 I-KP
Da I-KP
) O
can O
provoke O
a O
neutralizing O
immune O
response O
, O
particularly O
if O
the O
drugs O
are O
administered O
repeatedly O
, O
or O
in O
larger O
doses O
. O

This O
limits O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
drugs O
based O
on O
larger O
peptides O
and O
proteins O
( O
which O
are O
typically O
larger O
than O
6000 O
Da O
) O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
, O
the O
drug O
itself O
is O
not O
immunogenic O
, O
but O
may O
be O
co O
administered O
with O
an O
immunogenic O
compound O
, O
as O
is O
sometimes O
the O
case O
for O
Taxol O
. O

Computational O
methods O
have O
been O
developed O
to O
predict O
the O
immunogenicity O
of O
peptides O
and O
proteins O
, O
which O
are O
particularly O
useful O
in O
designing O
therapeutic O
antibodies O
, O
assessing O
likely O
virulence O
of O
mutations O
in O
viral O
coat O
particles O
, O
and O

of O

treatments O

Early O
techniques O
relied O
mainly O
on O
the O
observation O
that O
hydrophilic B-KP
amino I-KP
acids I-KP
are O
overrepresented O
in O
epitope O
regions O
than O
hydrophobic O
amino O
acids O
; O
however O
, O
more O
recent O
developments O
rely O
on O
machine O
learning O
techniques O
using O
databases O
of O
existing O
known O
epitopes O
, O
usually O
on O
well O
studied O
virus O
proteins O
, O
as O
a O
training O
set O
. O

A O
publicly O
accessible O
database O
has O
been O
established O
for O
the O
cataloguing O
of O
epitopes O
from O
pathogens O
known O
to O
be O
recognizable O
by O
B B-KP
cells I-KP
. O

The O
emerging O
field O
of O
bioinformatics O
based O
studies O
of O
immunogenicity O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
immunoinformatics B-KP

Immunoproteomics B-KP

the O
study O
of O
large O

involved O
in O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
negative O
consequences O
of O
sleep O

, O
sleep O
and O
the O
intertwined O
circadian O
system O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
strong O
regulatory O
effects O
on O
immunological O
functions O
affecting O
both O
the O
innate O

the O

. O

First O
, O
during O
the O
early O

stage O
, O
a O
sudden O
drop O
in O
blood O
levels O
of O
cortisol O
, O
epinephrine O

induce O
increased O

levels O
of O
the O
hormones O
leptin B-KP
, I-KP
pituitary I-KP
growth I-KP
hormone I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
prolactin I-KP
. O

These O
signals O
induce O
a O
pro O

state O
through O
the O
production O
of O
the O
pro O
inflammatory O
cytokines O
interleukin O
1 O
, O
interleukin O
12 O
, O
TNF O
alpha O
and O
IFN O
gamma O
. O

These O
cytokines O
then O
stimulate O
immune O
functions O
such O
as O
immune O

activation O
, O
proliferation O
, O
and O
differentiation O

In O

to O
these O
effects O
, O
the O

produced O
at O
this O
time O
( O
leptin O

This O
milieu O
is O
also O
thought O
to O
support O
the O
formation O
of O
long O
lasting O
immune O
memory O
through O
the O
initiation O
of O
Th1 B-KP
immune I-KP
responses I-KP
. O

In O
humans O
, O
this O
response O
is O
activated O
by O
complement O
binding O
to O
antibodies O
that O
have O
attached O
to O
these O
microbes O
or O
the O
binding O
of O
complement O
proteins O
to O
carbohydrates B-KP
on O
the O
surfaces O
of O
microbes O
. O

This O
recognition O
signal O
triggers O
a O
rapid O
killing O
response O
. O

The O
speed O
of O
the O
response O
is O
a O
result O
of O
signal B-KP
amplification I-KP
that O
occurs O
following O
sequential O
proteolytic O
activation O
of O
complement O
molecules O
, O
which O
are O
also O
proteases O
. O

After O
complement O
proteins O
initially O
bind O
to O
the O
microbe O
, O
they O
activate O
their O
protease O
activity O
, O
which O
in O
turn O
activates O
other O
complement O
proteases O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O

This O
produces O
a O
catalytic B-KP
cascade I-KP
that O
amplifies O
the O
initial O
signal O
by O
controlled O
positive O
feedback O
. O

The O
cascade O
results O
in O
the O
production O
of O
peptides O
that O
attract O
immune O

in I-KP
her I-KP
or I-KP
his I-KP
capacity I-KP
as I-KP
public B-KP
official I-KP
rather O
than O
private B-KP
citizen I-KP
. O

However O
, O
this O
definition O
is O
disputed O
by O
Thoreau B-KP
's I-KP
political O
philosophy O
pitching O
the O
conscience O
vs. O
the O
collective O
. O

The B-KP
individual B-KP
is O
the O
final O
judge O
of O
right O
and O
wrong O
. O

More O
than O
this O
, O
since O
only O
individuals O
act O
, O
only O
individuals B-KP
can O
act O
unjustly O
. O

When O
the O
government O
knocks O
on O
the O
door O
, O
it O
is O
an B-KP
individual I-KP
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
postman O
or O
tax O
collector O
whose O
hand O
hits O
the O
wood O
. O

Before O
Thoreau O
s O
imprisonment B-KP
, O
when O
a O
confused O
taxman O
had O
wondered O
aloud O
about O
how O
to O
handle O
his O
refusal B-KP
to I-KP
pay I-KP
, O
Thoreau B-KP
had O
advised O
, O
Resign B-KP
. O

If O
a O
man O
chose O
to O
be O
an O
agent O
of O
injustice O
, O
then O
Thoreau B-KP
insisted O
on O
confronting O
him O
with O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
was O
making O
a O
choice O
. O

But O
if O
government O
is O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
people O
, O
as O
it O
is O
often O
called O
, O
shouldn O
t O
that O
voice O
be O
heeded O
? O

Thoreau O
admits O
that O
government O
may O
express O
the O
will O
of O
the O
majority O
but O
it O
may O
also O
express O
nothing O
more O
than O
the B-KP
will I-KP
of I-KP
elite B-KP
politicians I-KP
. O

Even O
a O
good O
form O
of O
government O
is O
liable O
to O
be O
abused O
and O
perverted O
before O
the O
people O
can O
act O
through O
it O
. O

Moreover O
, O
even O
if O
a O
government O
did O
express O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
people O
, O
this O
fact O
would O
not O
compel O
the O
obedience O
of O
individuals B-KP
who O
disagree O
with O
what O
is O
being O
said O
. O

The B-KP
majority I-KP
may B-KP
be I-KP
powerful I-KP
but I-KP
it I-KP
is I-KP
not I-KP
necessarily I-KP
right I-KP
. O

What O
, O
then O
, O
is O
the O
proper O
relationship O
between O
the O
individual O
and O
the O
government O
? O

Some O
theories O
of O
civil O
disobedience O
hold O
that B-KP
civil I-KP
disobedience I-KP
is I-KP
only I-KP
justified I-KP
against I-KP
governmental I-KP
entities I-KP
. I-KP

Brownlee B-KP
argues O
that O
disobedience O
in O
opposition B-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
decisions I-KP
of I-KP
non I-KP
governmental I-KP
agencies I-KP
such I-KP
as I-KP
trade I-KP
unions I-KP
, I-KP
banks I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
private B-KP

can O
be O
justified O
if O
it B-KP
reflects I-KP

announced I-KP

civil B-KP

But O
Stephen O
Eilmann O
argues O
that O
if O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
disobey O
rules B-KP
that I-KP
conflict I-KP
with I-KP
morality I-KP
, O
we O
might O
ask O
why O
disobedience O
should O
take O
the O
form O
of O
public O
civil O
disobedience O
rather O
than O
simply O
covert B-KP
lawbreaking I-KP
. O

If O
a O

obstacles O

find O
that O
assisting B-KP
in I-KP
fabricating I-KP
evidence I-KP

committing I-KP
perjury I-KP
is O
more O
effective O
than O
open O

that O

The O

'' O

A O
technical O

may O
enhance O
the O
chances O

make O
for O

countries O

do O
not O
excuse O

purposes O

seek O

nullification B-KP

Over O
the O
years O

this O
has O
been O
made O
more O
difficult O
by O
court O
decisions O
such O
as O
Sparf O
v. O

held O
that O

openly O
seek O

nullification I-KP

One O
theory O
is O
that O
, O
while O
disobedience O
may O
be O
helpful O
, O
any B-KP
great I-KP
amount I-KP
of I-KP
it B-KP
would I-KP
undermine I-KP
the I-KP

general I-KP

is I-KP
neither B-KP
conscientious I-KP

Therefore O
, O
conscientious B-KP
lawbreakers I-KP

Michael O
Bayles O
argues O
that O
if O
a O
person O
violates O
a O

in O
order O
to O
create O
a O

case O
as O
to O
the O
constitutionality O
of O
a O
law O

and O
then O
wins O
his O
case O
, O
then O
that O
act O
did O
not O
constitute B-KP
civil I-KP
disobedience I-KP
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
argued O
that O
breaking B-KP
the I-KP
law I-KP
for I-KP
self I-KP
gratification I-KP
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O

user O
who O
does O
not O
direct O
his O
act O
at O
securing O
the O
repeal O
of O

of O
the O
law O
, O

not O

Likewise O
, O

attempts O

by O
denying O

committed O
the O

generally O
viewed B-KP

a I-KP
civil I-KP
disobedient I-KP

Courts O
have O
distinguished O
between O
two O
types O
of O
civil O
disobedience O
: O
`` O
Indirect B-KP
civil I-KP
disobedience I-KP
involves O
violating O
a O

which O
is O
not O

itself O

object O
of O
protest O
, O
whereas O
direct B-KP
civil I-KP
disobedience I-KP
involves O
protesting O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
particular O
law O
by O
breaking O
that O
law O

'' O

During O
the O
Vietnam B-KP
War I-KP
, O
courts O
typically O
refused O
to O
excuse O
the O

the O
basis O

their O
challenging O

The O
necessity B-KP

has O
sometimes O
been O
used O

to O

Brownlee O

Construction B-KP
is O
the O
process O
of O
constructing O
a O
building O

. O

Construction O
differs O
from O
manufacturing B-KP
in O
that O
manufacturing B-KP
typically O
involves O
mass O
production O
of O

items O
without O
a O

construction O
typically O
takes O
place O

Construction O
as O
an O

comprises O
six B-KP

nine I-KP
percent I-KP
of O
the O

In O
the O
modern O

usually O
involves O
the O
translation O

The O

employed O
by O
( O

in O

) O
the B-KP

Under O
this O
system O
, O
once O

by O
the O

, O
a O
number O

may O
then O
be O
asked O
to O
make O
a O

the O
work O
, O
either O

directly O
on O
the O

or O
on O
the O
basis O
of O

provided O
by O
a B-KP

The O
modern O
trend O
in O

toward O
integration O
of O

among I-KP

architects O
, O
interior O
designers O
, O

a O

an O
`` O

may O

have O
an O
associated O
company O
that O
provides O
each O

Thus O
, O
each O
such O

may O
offer O
itself O
as O
`` O

Several O

in O
this O
integration O
, O
including O

In O
general O

In O
response O

are O
growing O
beyond O

the O
other O
side O
to O
agree O
to O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
in O
exchange O
for O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O

The O
time O
element O
in O
construction O
means O
that B-KP
a I-KP
delay I-KP
costs I-KP
money I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
in I-KP
cases I-KP
of I-KP
bottlenecks I-KP
, I-KP
the I-KP
delay I-KP
can I-KP
be I-KP
extremely I-KP
expensive I-KP
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
contracts O
must O
be O
designed O
to O
ensure O
that B-KP
each B-KP
side I-KP
is I-KP
capable I-KP
of I-KP
performing I-KP
the I-KP
obligations I-KP
set I-KP
out I-KP
. O

Contracts O
that O
set O
out O
clear O
expectations O
and O
clear O
paths O
to O
accomplishing O
those O
expectations O
are O
far O
more O
likely O
to O
result O
in O
the O
project O
flowing O
smoothly O
, O
whereas O
poorly B-KP
drafted I-KP
contracts I-KP
lead O
to O
confusion O
and O
collapse O
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
growing O
number O
of O
new O
forms O
of O
procurement O
that O
involve O
relationship B-KP
contracting I-KP
where I-KP
the I-KP
emphasis I-KP
is I-KP
on I-KP
a I-KP
co I-KP
operative I-KP
relationship I-KP
between O
the O
principal O
and O
contractor O
and O
other O
stakeholders O
within O
a O
construction O
project O
. O

New O
forms O
include O
partnering O
such O
as O
Public B-KP
Private I-KP
Partnering I-KP
( O
PPPs O
) O
aka O
private B-KP
finance I-KP
initiatives I-KP
( I-KP
PFIs I-KP
) I-KP
and O
alliances O
such O
as O
`` O
pure O
'' O
or O
`` O
project O
'' O
alliances O
and O
`` O
impure O
'' O
or O
`` O
strategic O
'' O
alliances O
. O

The O
focus O
on O
co B-KP
operation I-KP
is O
to O
ameliorate O
the O
many O
problems O
that O
arise O
from O
the O
often O
highly O
competitive O
and O
adversarial O
practices O
within O
the O
construction O
industry O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
common O
method O
of O
construction O
procurement O
and O
is O
well O
established O
and O
recognized O
. O

In O
this O
arrangement O
, O
the B-KP
architect I-KP
or I-KP
engineer I-KP
acts O
as O
the B-KP
project B-KP
coordinator I-KP
. O

His O
or O
her O
role O
is O
to O
design O
the O
works O
, O
prepare O
the O
specifications O
and O
produce O
construction O
drawings O
, O
administer O
the O
contract O
, O
tender O
the O
works O
, O
and O
manage O
the O
works O
from O
inception O
to O
completion O
. O

There O
are O
direct O
contractual O
links O
between O
the B-KP
architect B-KP
's I-KP
client I-KP
and I-KP
the B-KP
main I-KP
contractor I-KP
. O

Any O
subcontractor O
has O
a O
direct O
contractual O
relationship O
with O
the B-KP
main B-KP
contractor I-KP
. O

The O
procedure O
continues O
until O
the B-KP
building B-KP
is I-KP
ready I-KP
to I-KP
occupy I-KP
. I-KP

The B-KP
owner I-KP
produces O
a O
list O
of O
requirements O
for O
a O
project O
, O
giving O
an O
overall O
view O
of O
the O
project O
's O
goals O
. O

Several B-KP
D I-KP
& I-KP
B I-KP
contractors I-KP
present O
different O
ideas O
about O
how O
to O
accomplish O
these O
goals O
. O

The B-KP
owner I-KP
selects O
the O
ideas O
he O
or O
she O
likes O
best O
and O
hires O
the O
appropriate O
contractor O
. O

Often O
, O
it O
is O
not O
just O
one O
contractor O
, O
but O
a B-KP
consortium I-KP
of I-KP
several I-KP
contractors I-KP
working O
together O
. O

Once O
these O
have O
been O
hired O
, O
they O
begin O
building O
the O
first O
phase O
of O
the O
project O
. O

As O
they O
build O
phase O
1 O
, O
they B-KP
design I-KP
phase I-KP
2 I-KP
. O

This O
is O
in O
contrast O
to O
a O
design O
bid O
build O
contract O
, O
where O
the O
project O
is O
completely O
designed O
by O
the O
owner O
, O
then O
bid O
on O
, O
then O
completed O
. O

Before O
the O
foundation O
can O
be O
dug O
, O
contractors B-KP
are O
typically O
required O
to O
verify O
and O
have O
existing O
utility O
lines O
marked O
, O
either O
by O
the O
utilities O
themselves O
or O
through O
a O
company O
specializing O
in O
such O
services O
. O

This O
lessens O
the B-KP
likelihood I-KP
of I-KP
damage I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
existing I-KP
electrical B-KP
, I-KP
water I-KP
, I-KP
sewage I-KP
, I-KP
phone I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
cable I-KP
facilities I-KP
, O
which O
could O
cause O
outages O
and O
potentially O
hazardous O
situations O
. O

During O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
building O
, O
the B-KP
municipal I-KP
building I-KP
inspector I-KP
inspects O
the O
building O
periodically O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
construction O
adheres O
to O
the O
approved O
plans O
and O
the O
local O
building O
code O
. O

Once O
construction O
is O
complete O
and O
a O
final O
inspection O
has O
been O
passed O
, O
an B-KP
occupancy I-KP
permit I-KP

Teachers O
at O
Ersatzschulen O
must O
have O
at O
least O
the O
same O
education O
and O
at O
least O
the O
same O
wages O
as O

at O

Article O

, O
Paragraph O
4 O
of O
the O
Grundgesetz O
, O
also O
forbids O
segregation O

according O
to O
the O
means O
of O
their O
parents O
( O
the O
so O
called O
Sonderungsverbot B-KP
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
most O
Ersatzschulen O
have O
very B-KP
low I-KP
tuition I-KP
fees I-KP
and/or O
offer O
scholarships O
, O
compared O
to O
most O
other O
Western O
European O
countries O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
finance O
these O
schools O
with O
such O
low O
tuition O
fees O
, O
which O
is O
why O
all O
German O
Ersatzschulen O
are O
additionally O
financed O
with O
public O
funds O
. O

The O
percentages O
of O
public O
money O
could O
reach O
100 O
% O
of O
the O
personnel O
expenditures O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
Private O
Schools O
became O
insolvent O
in O
the O
past O
in O
Germany O
. O

Erg B-KP
nzungsschulen I-KP
are O
secondary B-KP
or I-KP
post I-KP
secondary I-KP
( O
non O
tertiary O
) O
schools O
, O
which O
are O
run O
by O
private O
individuals O
, O
private O
organizations O
or O
rarely O
, O
religious B-KP
groups I-KP
and O
offer O
a O
type O
of O
education O
which O
is O
not O
available O
at O
public O
schools O
. O

Most O
of O
these O
schools O
are O
vocational B-KP
schools I-KP
. O

However O
, O
these O
vocational O
schools O
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
German O
dual O
education O
system O
. O

Erg O
nzungsschulen O
have O
the O
freedom O
to O
operate O
outside O
of O
government O
regulation O
and O
are O
funded O
in O
whole O
by O
charging O
their O
students O
tuition B-KP
fees I-KP
. O

In O
India O
, O
private O
schools O
are O
called O
independent B-KP
schools I-KP
, O
but O
since O
some O
private O
schools O
receive O
financial O
aid O
from O
the O
government O
, O
it O
can O
be O
an O
aided O
or O
an O
unaided O
school O
. O

So O
, O
in O
a O
strict O
sense O
, O
a O
private O
school O
is O
an O
unaided O
independent O
school O
. O

For O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
definition O
, O
only O
receipt O
of O
financial O
aid O
is O
considered O
, O
not O
land O
purchased O
from O
the O
government O
at O
a O

. O

It O
is O
within O
the O
power O
of O
both O
the O
union O
government O
and O
the O
state O
governments O
to O
govern O
schools O
since O
Education O
appears O
in O
the O
Concurrent O
list O
of O
legislative O
subjects O
in O
the O
constitution O
. O

The O
practice O
has O
been O
for O
the B-KP
union B-KP
government I-KP
to O
provide O
the O
broad O
policy O
directions O
while O
the O

create O
their O

and O

for O
the O

of O

. O

Among O
other O
things O
, O
this O
has O
also O
resulted O
in O
30 B-KP
different O
Examination O
Boards O
or O
academic O
authorities O
that O
conduct O

for O

Legally O
, O
only O

They O
will O
have O
to O

a O
number O

criteria O
to O
get O
Recognition O
( O
a O
form O
of O

) O
from O
the O

. O

Critics O
of O
this O
system O
point O
out O
that O
this O
leads O
to O
corruption O
by O
school O
inspectors O
who O
check O
compliance O
and O
to O
fewer O

in O
a O
country O
that O
has O
the O

While O
official O
data O
does O
not O
capture O
the O
real O
extent O
of O
private O

in O
the O
country O
, O
various O

have O
reported O
unpopularity O
of O

A O
key O
difference O
between O
the O
government O
and O
private O
schools O
is O
that O
the O
medium O
of O
education O
in O
private O
schools O
is O
English B-KP
while O
it O
is O
the O
local O

In O
Ireland O
, O
private O
schools O
( O
Irish O
: O
scoil B-KP
phr I-KP
obh I-KP
ideach I-KP
) O
are O
unusual O
because O
a B-KP
certain B-KP
number I-KP
of I-KP
teacher I-KP
's I-KP
salaries I-KP
are I-KP
paid I-KP
by I-KP
the I-KP
State I-KP
. O

If O
the O
school O
wishes O
to O
employ O
extra O
teachers O
they O
are O
paid O
for O
with O
school O
fees O
, O
which O
tend O
to O
be O
relatively O
low O
in O
Ireland O
compared O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
. O

There O
is O
, O
however O
, O
a O
limited O
element O
of O
state O
assessment O
of O
private O
schools O
, O
because O
of O
the O
requirement O
that O
the O
state O
ensure O
that O
children O
receive O
a O
certain O
minimum O
education O
; O
Irish O
private O
schools O
must O
still O
work O
towards O
the O
Junior O
Certificate O
and O
the O
Leaving O
Certificate O
, O
for O
example O
. O

Many O
private O
schools O
in O
Ireland O
also O
double O
as O
boarding O
schools O
. O

The O
average O
fee O
is O
around O
5,000 O
annually O
for O
most O
schools O
, O
but O
some O
of O
these O
schools O
also O
provide O
boarding O
and O
the O
fees O
may O
then O
rise O
up O
to O
25,000 O
per O
year O
. O

The O
fee O
paying O
schools O
are O
usually O
run O
by O
a O
religious O
order O
, O
i.e. O
, O
the B-KP
Society B-KP
of I-KP
Jesus I-KP
or O
Congregation O
of O
Christian O
Brothers O
, O
etc O
. O

After O
Malaysia O
's O
independence O
in O
1957 B-KP
, O
the O
government O
instructed O
all B-KP
schools O
to O
surrender O
their O
properties O
and O
be O
assimilated O
into O
the O
National B-KP
School I-KP
system O
. O

This O
caused O
an O
uproar O
among O
the O
Chinese O
and O
a O
compromise O
was O
achieved O
in O
that O
the O
schools O
would O
instead O
become O
`` O
National B-KP
Type I-KP
'' O
schools O
. O

Under O
such O
a O
system O
, O
the O
government O
is O
only O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
school O
curriculum O
and O
teaching O
personnel O
while O
the O
lands O
still O
belonged O
to O
the O
schools O
. O

While O
Chinese O
primary O
schools O
were O
allowed O
to O
retain O
Chinese B-KP
as O
the O
medium O
of O
instruction O
, O
Chinese O
secondary O
schools O
are O
required O
to O
change O
into O
English B-KP
medium O
schools O
. O

Over O
60 B-KP
schools O
converted O
to O
become O
National O
Type O
schools O
. O

The O
other O
category O
of O
schools O
are O
those O
run O
and O
partly O
or O
fully O
funded O
by O
private O
individuals O
, O
private O
organizations O
and O
religious O
groups O
. O

The O
ones O
that O
accept O
government O
funds O
are O
called O

' O
schools O
. O

The O
private O
'un O

' O
schools O
are O
fully B-KP
funded I-KP
by I-KP
private I-KP
parties I-KP
. O

The O
standard O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
education O
is O
quite O
high O
. O

Technically O
, O
these O
would O
be O
categorized O
as O
private O
schools O
, O
but O
many O
of O
them O
have O
the O
name O
`` O
Public O
School O
'' O
appended O
to O
them O
, O
e.g. O
, O
the O
Galaxy O
Public O
School O
in O
Kathmandu B-KP
. O

Most O
of O
the O
middle O
class O
families O
send O
their O
children O
to O
such O
schools O
, O
which O
might O
be O
in O
their O
own O
city O
or O
far O
off O
, O
like O
boarding O
schools O
. O

The O
medium O
of O
education O
is O
English B-KP
, O
but O
as O
a O
compulsory O
subject O
, O
Nepali B-KP
and/or O
the O
state O
's O
official O
language O
is O
also O
taught O
. O

Preschool O
education O
is O
mostly O
limited O
to O
organized O
neighbourhood O
nursery O
schools O
. O

As O
of O
April O
2014 O
, O
there O
are O
88 B-KP
private O
schools O
in O
New O

, O
catering O
for O
around O
28,000 B-KP
students O
or O
3.7 B-KP
% I-KP
of O
the O
entire O
student O
population O
. O

Private O
school O
numbers O
have O
been O
in O
decline O
since O
the O
mid O
1970s O
as O
a O
result O
of O
many O
private O
schools O
opting O
to O
become O
state O
integrated O
schools O
, O
mostly O
due O
of O
financial O
difficulties O
stemming O
from O
changes O
in O
student O
numbers O
and/or O
the O
economy O
. O

State O
integrated O
schools O
keep O
their O
private O

special O
character O
and O
receives O
state O
funds O
in O
return O
for O
having O
to O
operate O
like O
a O

school O
, O
e.g O

they O
must O

they O
must O
employ O

for O
the O

. O

The O
largest O
decline O
in O
private O

occurred O
between O

when O

a O

In O
the O

In O

Louis B-KP
Agassiz I-KP
were O
acclaimed O
both O
in O
New O
York O
and O
on O
the O
campus O
at O
Harvard O
College O
. O

Agassiz O
's O
approach O
was O
distinctly O
idealist O
and O
posited O
Americans O
' O
`` O
participation O
in O
the O
Divine O
Nature O
'' O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
understanding O
`` O
intellectual O
existences O
'' O
. O

Agassiz O
's O
perspective O
on O
science O
combined O
observation O
with O
intuition B-KP
and O
the O
assumption O
that O
a O
person O
can O
grasp O
the O
`` O
divine O
plan O
'' O
in O
all O
phenomena O
. O

When O
it O
came O
to O
explaining O
life O
forms O
, O
Agassiz O
resorted O
to O
matters O
of O
shape O
based O
on O
a O
presumed O
archetype O
for O
his O
evidence O
. O

This O
dual O
view O
of O
knowledge O
was O
in O
concert O
with O
the O
teachings O
of O
Common O
Sense O
Realism O
derived O
from O
Scottish O
philosophers O
Thomas B-KP

, O
whose O
works O
were O
part O

time O
. O

The O
popularity O
of O
Agassiz O
's O
efforts O
to O
`` O
soar O
with O
Plato O
'' O
probably O
also O
derived O
from O
other O
writings O
to O
which O
Harvard O
students O
were O
exposed O
, O
including O
Platonic O
treatises O
by O
Ralph O
Cudworth O

John O
Norrisand O
, O
in O
a O
Romantic O
vein O
, O
Samuel O
Coleridge O
. O

The O
library O
records O
at O
Harvard O
reveal O
that O
the O
writings O
of O
Plato O
and O
his O
early O
modern O
and O
Romantic O
followers O
were O
almost O
as O
regularly O
read O
during O
the O
19th O
century O
as O
those O
of O
the O
`` O
official O
philosophy O
'' O
of O
the O
more O
empirical O

more O
deistic O
Scottish O
school O

not O

Derived O
from O
William B-KP

these O

were O

the O

which O
dates O
back O
to O
1875 B-KP
and O
is O
usually O
called O
simply O
`` O
The O

'' O
. O

While O

no O

one O
of O

as O
it O

, O
both O
it O

In O
1903 B-KP
, O
Harvard O
Stadium O
introduced O

of O
its O
kind O
in O

Walter O
Camp O
( O

, O
suggested O
widening O
the O
field O

open O
up O
the O
game O
. O

But O
the O
stadium O
was O
too O
narrow O
to O

a O
wider O

So O
, O
other O
steps O

to O
be O
taken O

instead O
support O

Neoclassical B-KP

Within O

value B-KP
added I-KP

different I-KP
classifications I-KP
of I-KP

In O
this O
perspective O

Thus O
, O
in O
a O

a O
reflection O

Over O
the O

this O

increases O
the O

that O

The O
substitution B-KP
of I-KP
capital I-KP

labor I-KP
( O

raises B-KP

the O

In O
a O
purely O

mode O

( O

can O

rather O
by O
the B-KP

Wages O

in O
the O

way O

This O
is O
because O
competition B-KP
between I-KP

An O
example O
of O
this O
would O
be O
jobs O
such O

Competition B-KP

This O
is O
because O
competition B-KP
between I-KP
employers I-KP

will O
drive O
up O
the O

Competition O
amongst O

to O
drive O
up O

due O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
job O

since O

a O
relative O

Professional B-KP

labor I-KP
organizations I-KP

limit O
the O

results O
in O

corruption I-KP

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
higher B-KP
economic I-KP
inequality I-KP
tends O
to O
increase O
entrepreneurship B-KP
rates I-KP
at O
the O
individual O
level O
( O
self O

) O
. O

However O
, O
most O
of O
it O
is O
often O
based O
on O
necessity B-KP
rather I-KP
than I-KP
opportunity I-KP
. O

Necessity B-KP
based I-KP
entrepreneurship I-KP
is O
motivated O
by O
survival O
needs O
such O
as O
income O
for O
food O
and O
shelter O
( O
`` O
push B-KP
'' O
motivations O
) O
, O
whereas O
opportunity B-KP
based I-KP
entrepreneurship I-KP
is O
driven O
by O
achievement B-KP
oriented I-KP
motivations I-KP
( I-KP
`` I-KP
pull I-KP

) I-KP
such O
as O
vocation O
and O
more O
likely O
to O
involve O
the O
pursue O
of O
new O
products O
, O

, O
or O
underserved O
market O
needs O
. O

The O
economic O
impact O
of O
the O
former O
type O
of O
entrepreneurialism O
tends O
to O
be O
redistributive O
while O
the O
latter O
is O
expected O
to O
foster O
technological O
progress O
and O
thus O
have O
a O
more B-KP
positive I-KP
impact O
on O
economic O
growth O
. O

Another O
cause O
is O
the O
rate O
at O
which O
income O
is O
taxed O
coupled O
with O
the O
progressivity O
of O
the O
tax B-KP
system I-KP
. O

A O
progressive B-KP
tax I-KP
is O
a O
tax O
by O
which O
the B-KP
tax B-KP
rate I-KP
increases O
as O
the O
taxable O
base O
amount O
increases O
. O

In O
a O
progressive B-KP
tax I-KP
system I-KP
, O
the O
level B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
top B-KP
tax I-KP
rate I-KP
will O
often O
have O
a O
direct O
impact O
on O
the O
level O
of O
inequality O
within O
a O
society O
, O
either O
increasing O
it O
or O
decreasing O
it O
, O
provided O
that O
income O
does O
not O
change O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
change O
in O
tax O
regime O
. O

Additionally O
, O
steeper B-KP
tax I-KP
progressivity I-KP
applied I-KP
to I-KP
social B-KP
spending I-KP
can O
result O
in O
a O
more O
equal O
distribution O
of O
income O
across O
the O
board O
. O

The O
difference O
between O
the O
Gini B-KP
index O
for O
an O
income O
distribution O
before O
taxation O
and O
the B-KP
Gini I-KP
index I-KP
after O
taxation O
is O
an O
indicator O
for O
the O
effects O
of O
such O
taxation O
. O

An O
important O
factor O
in O
the O
creation O
of O
inequality O
is O
variation O
in O
individuals O
' O
access B-KP
to I-KP
education I-KP
. O

Education B-KP
, O
especially O
in O
an O
area O
where O
there O
is O
a O
high O
demand O
for O
workers O
, O
creates O
high B-KP
wages I-KP
for O
those O
with O
this O
education B-KP
, O
however O
, O
increases O
in O
education O
first O
increase O
and O
then O
decrease O
growth O
as O
well O
as O
income O
inequality O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
those O
who O
are O
unable O
to O
afford O
an O
education B-KP
, I-KP
or O
choose O
not O
to O
pursue O
optional B-KP
education B-KP
, O
generally O
receive O
much O
lower B-KP
wages I-KP
. O

The O
justification O
for O
this O
is O
that O
a O
lack O
of O
education O
leads O
directly O
to O
lower B-KP
incomes I-KP
, O
and O
thus O
lower O
aggregate O
savings B-KP
and I-KP
investment I-KP
. O

Conversely O
, O
education B-KP
raises O
incomes O
and O
promotes O
growth O
because O
it O
helps O
to O
unleash O
the O
productive O
potential O
of O
the O
poor B-KP
. O

It O

During O
the O

1910 B-KP
1940 I-KP
, O
there O
was O
an B-KP

which O
led O
to O
a B-KP

In O
fact O
, O
it O
differs O
from O
the O
present O
high O

education O
, O
which O
is O
regarded O
as O
a O
stepping O
stone O
to O
acquire O
college O
and O
advanced O

. O

This O
decrease B-KP
in I-KP
wages I-KP
caused O
a O
period B-KP

decreased O
inequality O

Education B-KP
is O
very O
important O
for O

Lagerlof O

continued B-KP
gender I-KP

, O
thus O
creating O
a O

It O
is O
suggested O
that O
a O
large O
gap O
in O
male O

education O
may O
indicate O
backwardness O

so O
may O
be O

in O

According O
to O
Kuznets O
, O

have O
relatively B-KP
equal I-KP
distributions I-KP

wealth I-KP
. O

As O
a O
country O
develops O
, O
it O
acquires O
more B-KP
capital I-KP

which O
leads O
to O
the O
owners O
of O
this O
capital O

more B-KP

introducing O

such I-KP

Plotting O
the O
relationship O

Kuznets B-KP

Kuznets B-KP

Kuznets O
demonstrated O
this O

However O
, O
more O
recent O

this O

shown O
it O

be O
very B-KP

Kuznets O
' O

eventually B-KP
decrease B-KP

As O

did O
fall O

: O

Following O
the O

principle O
of O
seeking O
the B-KP
greatest B-KP
good B-KP
for O
the O
greatest O
number O
economic O
inequality O

problematic O

A O
house O
that O

a O

as O
a O
summer O

than O
it O
would O
to O
a O
homeless O
family O
of O

, O
is O
an O
example O
of O
reduced O
`` O
distributive B-KP
efficiency I-KP
'' O
within O
society O
, O
that O
decreases O
marginal O
utility O
of O
wealth O
and O
thus O
the O
sum O
total O
of O
personal O
utility O
. O

An O
additional O
dollar O
spent O
by O
a O
poor O
person O
will O
go O
to O
things O
providing O
a B-KP
great I-KP
deal I-KP
of I-KP
utility I-KP
to O
that O
person O
, O
such O
as O
basic B-KP
necessities I-KP

; O
while O
, O
an O
additional O
dollar O
spent O
by O
a O
much O
richer O
person O
will O
very O
likely O
go O
to O
luxury O

less O
utility O

Thus O
, O
the O
marginal O
utility O
of O
wealth O
per O
person O
( O
`` O
the O

) O
decreases B-KP
as O
a O

. O

From O
this O
standpoint O
, O
for O
any O
given O
amount O
of O
wealth O
in O
society O
, O
a O
society O
with O
more O

will O
have O
higher B-KP

Some O
studies O

found O

this O
theory O

Conservative O
researchers O
have O
argued O
that O
income O
inequality O
is O
not O
significant O
because O
consumption B-KP
, O
rather O
than O
income O
should O
be O
the O
measure O

and O
inequality O

the O

Will O
Wilkinson O

improved O
equality O
can O
help O
sustain O
growth O
has O
become O
more O
widely O
held O
in O
recent O
years O
. O

... O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
this O
shift O
is O
the O
increasing B-KP
importance I-KP
of I-KP
human I-KP
capital I-KP
in I-KP
development I-KP
. O

When O
physical O
capital O
mattered O
most O
, O
savings O
and O
investments O
were O
key O
. O

Then O
it O
was O
important O
to O
have O
a O
large O
contingent O
of O
rich O
people O
who O
could O
save O
a O
greater O
proportion O
of O
their O
income O
than O
the O
poor O
and O
invest O
it O
in O
physical O
capital O
. O

But O
now O
that O
human O
capital O
is O
scarcer O
than O
machines O
, O
widespread B-KP
education I-KP
has O
become O
the O
secret O
to O
growth O
. O
'' O

In O
1993 B-KP
, O
Galor O
and O
Zeira O
showed O
that O
inequality O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
credit O
market O
imperfections O
has O
a O
long B-KP
lasting I-KP
detrimental I-KP
effect I-KP
on O
human O
capital O
formation O
and O
economic O
development O
. O

A O
1996 O
study O
by O
Perotti O
examined O
the O
channels B-KP
through I-KP
which I-KP
inequality I-KP
may I-KP
affect I-KP
economic I-KP
growth I-KP
. O

He O
showed O
that O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
credit O
market O
imperfection O
approach O
, O
inequality O
is O
associated O
with O
lower O
level O
of O
human O
capital O
formation O
( O
education O
, O
experience O
, O
and O
apprenticeship O
) O
and O
higher O
level O
of O
fertility B-KP
, O
and O
thereby O
lower O
levels O
of O
growth O
. O

He O
found O
that O
inequality O
is O
associated O
with O
higher O
levels O
of O
redistributive B-KP
taxation I-KP
, O
which O
is O
associated O
with O
lower O
levels O
of O
growth O
from O
reductions O
in O
private O
savings O
and O
investment O
. O

Perotti O
concluded O
that O
, O
`` O
more O
equal O
societies O
have O
lower O
fertility O
rates O
and O
higher O
rates O
of O
investment O
in O
education O
. O

Both O
are O
reflected O
in O
higher O
rates O
of O
growth O
. O

Also O
, O
very O
unequal O
societies O
tend O
to O
be O
politically B-KP
and I-KP
socially I-KP
unstable I-KP
, O
which O
is O
reflected O
in O
lower O
rates O
of O
investment O
and O
therefore O
growth O
. O
'' O

Research O
by O
Harvard B-KP
economist O
Robert O
Barro O
, O
found O
that O
there O
is O
`` O
little O
overall O
relation O
between O
income O
inequality O
and O
rates O
of O
growth B-KP
and I-KP
investment I-KP
'' O
. O

According O
to O
work O
by O
Barro O
in O
1999 O
and O
2000 O
, O
high O
levels O
of O
inequality O
reduce B-KP
growth I-KP
in O
relatively O
poor O
countries O
but O
encourage B-KP
growth I-KP
in O
richer O
countries O
. O

A O
study O
of O
Swedish O
counties O
between B-KP
1960 I-KP
and I-KP
2000 I-KP
found O
a O
positive O
impact O
of O
inequality O
on O
growth O
with O
lead O
times O
of O
five O
years O
or O
less O
, O
but O
no O
correlation O
after O
ten O
years O
. O

Studies O
of O
larger O
data O
sets O
have O
found O
no O
correlations O
for O
any O
fixed O
lead O
time O
, O
and O
a O
negative O
impact O
on O
the O
duration O
of O
growth O
. O

Studies O
on O
income O
inequality O
and O
growth O
have O
sometimes O
found O
evidence O
confirming O
the O
Kuznets B-KP
curve I-KP
hypothesis I-KP
, O
which O
states O
that O
with O
economic O
development O
, O
inequality B-KP
first I-KP
increases B-KP
, O
then O
decreases O
. O

Economist B-KP
Thomas B-KP
Piketty I-KP
challenges O
this O
notion O
, O
claiming O
that O
from O
1914 O
to O
1945 O
wars B-KP
and I-KP
`` I-KP
violent I-KP
economic I-KP
and I-KP
political I-KP
shocks I-KP
'' I-KP
reduced O
inequality O
. O

Moreover O
, O
Piketty O
argues O
that O
the O
`` O
magical O
'' O
Kuznets O
curve O
hypothesis O
, O
with O
its O
emphasis O
on O
the O
balancing O
of O
economic O
growth O
in O
the O
long O
run O
, O
can O
not O
account O
for O
the O
significant O
increase O
in O
economic O
inequality O
throughout O
the O
developed O
world O
since O
the O
1970s O
. O

Some O
theories O
developed O
in O
the B-KP
1970s B-KP
established O
possible O
avenues O
through O
which O
inequality O
may O
have O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
economic O
development O
. O

According O
to O
a O
1955 O
review O
, O
savings O
by O
the O
wealthy O
, O
if O
these O
increase O
with O
inequality O
, O
were O
thought O
to O
offset O
reduced B-KP
consumer I-KP
demand I-KP
. O

A O
2013 O
report O
on O
Nigeria O
suggests O
that O
growth O
has O
risen B-KP
with I-KP
increased I-KP
income I-KP
inequality I-KP
. O

Some O
theories O
popular O
from O
the O
1950s O
to O
2011 O
incorrectly O
stated O
that O
inequality O
had O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
economic O
development O
. O

Analyses O
based O
on O
comparing O
yearly O
equality O
figures O
to O
yearly O
growth O
rates O
were O
misleading O
because O
it O
takes O
several B-KP
years I-KP
for O
effects O
to O
manifest O
as O
changes O
to O
economic O
growth O
. O

IMF O
economists O
found O
a O
strong O
association O
between O
lower O
levels O
of O
inequality O
in O
developing O
countries O
and O
sustained O
periods O
of O
economic O
growth O
. O

Developing O
countries O
with O
high O
inequality O
have O
`` O
succeeded O
in O
initiating O
growth O
at O
high O
rates O
for O
a O
few O
years O
'' O
but O
`` O
longer O
growth O
spells O
are O
robustly O
associated O
with O
more B-KP
equality B-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
income I-KP
distribution I-KP
. O
'' O

While O
acknowledging O
the O
central O
role O
economic O
growth O
can O
potentially O
play O
in O
human O
development O
, O
poverty O
reduction O
and O
the O
achievement O
of O
the O
Millennium O
Development O
Goals O
, O
it O
is O
becoming O
widely O
understood O
amongst O
the O
development O
community O
that O
special B-KP
efforts I-KP
must O
be O
made O
to O
ensure O
poorer O
sections O
of O
society O
are O
able O
to O
participate O
in O
economic O
growth O
. O

The O
effect O
of O
economic O
growth O
on O
poverty O
reduction O
the O
growth O
elasticity O
of O
poverty O
can O
depend O
on O
the O
existing B-KP
level I-KP
of I-KP
inequality I-KP
. O

For O
instance O
, O
with O
low O
inequality O
a O
country O
with O
a O

rate O
of O
2 O
% O
per O
head O
and O
40 O
% O
of O
its O
population O
living O
in O
poverty O
, O
can O
halve B-KP
poverty I-KP
in O
ten O
years O
, O
but O
a O
country O
with O
high O
inequality O
would O
take O
nearly O
60 O
years O
to O
achieve O
the O
same O
reduction B-KP

In O

In O

Reasons O
for O

include O
excessive O

Other O

of O
researchers O
( O
David O
Rodda O
, O
Jacob O
Vigdor O
, O

Janna O
Matlack O

, O
argue O
that O
a B-KP
shortage I-KP
of I-KP
affordable B-KP
housing I-KP
at O
least O
in O
the O
US O
is O
caused O
in O
part O
by O
income O

David O
Rodda O
noted O
that O
from O
1984 O
and O
1991 O
, O
the O
number O
of O
quality B-KP
rental I-KP
units I-KP
decreased O
as O
the O
demand B-KP
for I-KP

quality I-KP

increased I-KP
( O

Through O
gentrification B-KP
of I-KP
older I-KP
neighbourhoods I-KP
, O
for O
example O
, O
in O
East O
New O
York O
, O
rental O
prices O
increased O
rapidly O
as O
landlords O
found O
new B-KP
residents I-KP
willing I-KP
to I-KP
pay I-KP
higher I-KP
market I-KP
rate I-KP
for I-KP

. O

The O
ad B-KP
valorem I-KP
property B-KP
tax I-KP
policy I-KP
combined O
with O
rising O
prices O
made O
it O
difficult O
or O
impossible O
for O
low O
income O

to O
keep O
pace O
. O

Firstly O
, O
certain O
costs O
are O
difficult O
to O
avoid O
and O
are O
shared O
by B-KP
everyone I-KP
, O
such O
as O
the O
costs O
of O
housing O
, O
pensions O
, O
education O
and O
health O
care O
. O

If O
the O
state O
does O
not O
provide O
these O
services O
, O
then O
for O
those O
on O
lower O
incomes O
, O
the O
costs O
must O
be O
borrowed O
and O
often O
those O
on O
lower O

are O
those O
who O
are O
worse O
equipped O

Secondly O
, O
aspirational B-KP

the O
process O

aspiring O
to O
achieve O
the O
standards O

one O
method O
of O
achieving O
this O
aspiration O
is O
by O
taking B-KP

The O
result O
leads O
to O
even O
greater B-KP
inequality I-KP

potential I-KP
economic I-KP
instability I-KP

The O
smaller O
the O
economic O

created B-KP
, O
resulting O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
in O
more O
environmental O
degradation O
. O

This O
can O
be O
explained O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
as O
the O
poor O
people O
in O
the O
society O
become O
more O
wealthy O
, O
it O
increases O
their O
yearly O
carbon O

This O
relation O

[ O
not O
in O

It O
should O
be O
noted O
here O
however O
that O
in O
certain O
cases O
, O
with O
great O
economic O
inequality O

there O
is O
nonetheless O
not O
more O

cleaned O
up O
better O
afterwards O

) O
... O

Also O
note O
that O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
increase O
in O
environmental B-KP
degradation I-KP
is O
the O
result O
of O
the O
increase O
of O
emissions B-KP
per I-KP
person I-KP
being O
multiplied O
by O
a O
multiplier O
. O

If O
there O
were O
fewer O
people O
however O
, O
this B-KP
multiplier I-KP
would O
be O
lower O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
amount O
of O
environmental B-KP
degradation I-KP
would O
be O
lower O
as O
well O
. O

As O
such O
, O
the O
current O
high O
level O
of O
population O
has O
a O
large O
impact O
on O
this B-KP
as I-KP
well I-KP
. O

If B-KP
( I-KP
as I-KP
WWF I-KP
argued I-KP
) I-KP
, I-KP
population B-KP
levels I-KP
would I-KP
start I-KP
to I-KP
drop I-KP
to I-KP
a I-KP
sustainable I-KP
level I-KP
( O
1/3 O
of O
current O
levels O
, O
so O
about O
2 O
billion O
people O
) O
, O
human O
inequality O
can O
be O
addressed/corrected O

while O
still O
not O

in O
an O
increase O
of O

Socialists O
attribute O
the O
vast O

ownership I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
means I-KP
of I-KP

By O
contrast O

In O
order O
to O
rectify O
this O
situation O
, O
socialists O
argue O
that O
the O
means O
of O

should O
be O
socially B-KP

that O

be O
reflective B-KP

Robert B-KP
Nozick I-KP
argued O
that O
government O
redistributes O
wealth O
by O
force O
( O
usually O
in O
the O
form O
of O
taxation B-KP
) O
, O
and O
that O
the O
ideal O

society O
would O
be O
one O
where O
all O
individuals O
are O
free O
from O
force B-KP
. O

However O
, O
Nozick O
recognized O
that O
some O
modern O
economic O
inequalities O
were O
the O
result O
of O
forceful B-KP
taking I-KP
of I-KP
property I-KP
, O
and O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
redistribution O
would O
be O
justified O
to O
compensate O
for O
this O
force O
but O
not O
because O
of O
the O
inequalities O
themselves O
. O

John O
Rawls O
argued O
in O
A O
Theory O

Justice O
that O
inequalities O
in O
the O
distribution O

are O
only O
justified O
when B-KP

Rawls O
does O
not O
discuss O
the O
full O
implications O

theory O

Some O
see O
Rawls O

argument O
as O
a O
justification O
for O
capitalism O
since O
even O
the O

theoretically O
benefit O

He O

Ogedei B-KP

The O

Kublai O
curbed O
the O

He O
feared O
that O
his O

left O
him O
vulnerable O

future O

and O
defections O
to O
the O

Kublai O

China I-KP

satisfying I-KP
the I-KP

The O

the O

The O
system O
of O
bureaucracy O
created O
by O
Kublai O
Khan O
reflected O
various O
cultures O
in O

While O
the O
official O
terminology O
of O
the O
institutions O
may O
indicate O
the O
government O
structure O
was O
almost O
purely O
that O
of O
native B-KP
Chinese I-KP
dynasties I-KP
, O
the O
Yuan O
bureaucracy O
actually O
consisted O
of O
a O
mix O
of O
elements O
from O
different O
cultures O
. O

The O
Chinese O
style O
elements O
of O
the O
bureaucracy O
mainly O
came O
from O
the O
native O
Tang B-KP
, I-KP
Song I-KP
, I-KP
as I-KP
well I-KP
as I-KP
Khitan I-KP
Liao I-KP
and I-KP
Jurchen I-KP
Jin I-KP
dynasties I-KP
. O

Chinese O
advisers O
such O
as O
Liu B-KP
Bingzhong I-KP
and I-KP
Yao I-KP
Shu I-KP
gave O
strong O
influence O
to O
Kublai O
's O
early O
court O
, O
and O
the O
central O
government O
administration O
was O
established O
within O
the O
first O
decade O
of O
Kublai O
's O
reign O
. O

This O
government O
adopted O
the O
traditional O
Chinese O
tripartite B-KP
division I-KP
of O
authority O
among O
civil B-KP
, I-KP
military I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
censorial I-KP
offices I-KP
, O
including O
the O
Central O
Secretariat O
( O
Zhongshu O
Sheng O
) O
to O
manage O
civil O
affairs O
, O
the O
Privy O
Council O
( O
Chinese O
: O
) O
to O
manage O
military O
affairs O
, O
and O
the O
Censorate O
to O
conduct O
internal O
surveillance O
and O
inspection O
. O

The O
actual O
functions O
of O
both O
central O
and O
local O
government O
institutions O
, O
however O
, O
showed O
a O
major O
overlap O
between O
the O
civil O
and O
military O
jurisdictions O
, O
due O
to O
the O
Mongol O
traditional O
reliance O
on O
military O
institutions O
and O
offices O
as O
the O
core O
of O
governance O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
such O
a O
civilian O
bureaucracy O
, O
with O
the O
Central O
Secretariat O
as O
the O
top O
institution O
that O
was O
( O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
) O
responsible O
for O
most O
other O
governmental O
agencies O
( O
such O
as O
the O
traditional O
Chinese O
style O
Six O
Ministries O
) O
, O
was O
created O
in O
China O
. O

At O
various O
times O
another O
central O
government O
institution O
called O
the O
Department O
of O
State O
Affairs O
( O
Shangshu O
Sheng O
) O
that O
mainly O
dealt O
with O
finance O
was O
established O
( O
such O
as O
during O
the O
reign O
of O
K O
l O
g O
Khan O
or O
Emperor O
Wuzong O
) O
, O
but O
was O
usually O
abandoned O
shortly O
afterwards O
. O

While O
the O
existence O
of O
these O
central O
government O
departments O
and O
the O
Six O
Ministries O
( O
which O
had O
been O
introduced O
since B-KP
the I-KP
Sui I-KP
and I-KP
Tang I-KP
dynasties I-KP
) O
gave O
a O
Sinicized O
image O
in O
the O
Yuan O
administration O
, O
the O
actual O
functions O
of O
these O
ministries O
also O
reflected O
how O
Mongolian O
priorities O
and O
policies O
reshaped O
and O
redirected O
those O
institutions O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
Yuan O
legal O
system O
, O
the O
Ministry O
of O
Justice O
, O
did O
not O
extend O
to O
legal O
cases O
involving O
Mongols B-KP
and I-KP
Semuren I-KP
, O
who O
had O
separate O
courts O
of O
justice O
. O

Cases O
involving O
members O
of O
more O
than O
one O
ethnic O
group O
were O
decided O
by O
a O
mixed O
board O
consisting O
of O
Chinese O
and O
Mongols O
. O

Another O
example O
was O
the O
insignificance O
of O
the B-KP
Ministry I-KP
of I-KP
War I-KP
compared O
with O
native O
Chinese O
dynasties O
, O
as O
the O
real O
military O
authority O
in O
Yuan O
times O
resided O
in O
the B-KP
Privy I-KP
Council I-KP
. O

Since O
its O
invention O
in O
1269 B-KP
, O
the O
'Phags O

script O
, O
a O
unified O
script O
for O
spelling O
Mongolian B-KP
, I-KP
Tibetan I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
Chinese I-KP
languages O
, O
was O
preserved O
in O
the O
court O
until O
the O
end O
of O
the O
dynasty O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
Emperors O
could B-KP
not I-KP
master I-KP
written I-KP
Chinese I-KP
, I-KP
but I-KP
they I-KP
could I-KP
generally I-KP
converse I-KP
well B-KP
in O
the O
language O
. O

The O
Mongol O
custom O
of O
long O
standing O
quda/marriage O
alliance O
with O
Mongol O
clans O
, O
the O
Onggirat O
, O
and O
the O
Ikeres O
, O
kept O
the O
imperial O
blood O
purely O
Mongol O
until O
the O
reign O
of O
Tugh B-KP
Temur I-KP
, O
whose O
mother O
was O
a O
Tangut O
concubine O
. O

The O
Mongol O
Emperors O
had O
built O
large O
palaces O
and O
pavilions O
, O
but O
some O
still O
continued O
to O
live O
as O
nomads O
at O
times O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
a O
few O
other O
Yuan O
emperors O
actively O
sponsored O
cultural O
activities O
; O
an O
example O
is O
Tugh O
Temur O
( O
Emperor B-KP
Wenzong B-KP
) O
, O
who O
wrote O
poetry O
, O
painted O
, O
read O
Chinese O
classical O
texts O
, O
and O
ordered O
the O
compilation O
of O
books O
. O

The O
average O
Mongol O
garrison O
family O
of O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
seems O
to O
have O
lived O
a O
life O
of O
decaying O
rural O
leisure O
, O
with O
income B-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
harvests B-KP
of I-KP
their I-KP
Chinese I-KP
tenants I-KP
eaten O
up O
by O
costs O
of O
equipping O
and O
dispatching O
men O
for O
their O
tours O
of O
duty O
. O

The O
Mongols O
practiced O
debt O
slavery O
, O
and O
by O
1290 B-KP
in O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
Mongol O
Empire O
commoners O
were O
selling O
their O
children O
into O
slavery O
. O

Seeing O
this O
as O
damaging O
to O
the O
Mongol O
nation O
, O
Kublai O
in O
1291 B-KP
forbade O
the O
sale O
abroad O
of O
Mongols O
. O

Kublai O
wished O
to O
persuade O
the O
Chinese O
that O
he O
was O
becoming O
increasingly O
sinicized O
while O
maintaining O
his O
Mongolian O
credentials O
with O
his O
own O
people O
. O

He O
set O
up O
a O
civilian O
administration O
to O
rule O
, O
built O
a O
capital O
within O
China O
, O
supported O
Chinese O
religions O
and O
culture O
, O
and O
devised O
suitable O
economic O
and O
political O
institutions O
for O
the O
court O
. O

But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
never O
abandoned O
his O
Mongolian O
heritage O
. O

In O
the O
China O
of O
the O
Yuan O
, O
or O
Mongol O
era O
, O
various O
important O
developments O
in O
the O

occurred O

, I-KP
and I-KP
theater I-KP
, O
with O
many O
great O
artists O
and O
writers O
being O
famous O
today O
. O

Due O
to O
the O
coming O
together O
of O
painting B-KP
, I-KP
poetry I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
calligraphy I-KP
at O
this O
time O
many O
of O
the O
artists O
practicing O
these O
different O
pursuits O
were O
the O

individuals O
, O
though O
perhaps O
more O
famed O
for O
one O
area O
of O
their O
achievements O
than O
others O

Often O
in O
terms O
of O
the O

as O

, O
the B-KP
Song I-KP
dynasty I-KP
and O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
are O
linked O
together O
. O

In O
the O
area O
of O
Chinese O
painting O
during O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
there O
were O
many O
famous O
painters O
. O

In O
the O
area O
of O
calligraphy O
many O
of O
the O
great O
calligraphers O
were O
from O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
era O
. O

In O
Yuan O
poetry O
, O
the O
main O
development O
was O
the B-KP
qu B-KP
, O
which O
was O
used O
among O
other O
poetic O
forms O
by O
most O
of O
the O
famous O
Yuan O
poets O

Many O
of O
the O
poets O
were O
also O
involved O
in O
the O
major O
developments O
in O

and O
the O
other O
way O
around O

with O
people O
important O
in O

becoming O
famous O
through O
the O
development O
of O
the O

. O

One O
of O
the O
key O
factors O
in O
the O
mix O
of O
the O

variety O
show O
was O
the O
incorporation O
of O
poetry O
both O
classical O

of O
the O
newer O
qu O
form O
. O

One O
of O
the O
important O
cultural O
developments O
during O
the O
Yuan O
era O
was O
the O
consolidation O
of O
poetry O
, O
painting O
, O
and O
calligraphy O
into O
a O
unified O
piece O
of O
the O
type O
that O
tends O
to O
come O
to O
mind O
when O
people O
think O
of O
classical O
Chinese O
art O
. O

Another O
important O
aspect O
of O
Yuan O
times O
is O
the O
increasing O
incorporation O
of O
the O
then O
current O
, O
vernacular O
Chinese O
into O
both O
the O
qu O
form O
of O
poetry O
and O
the O
zaju O
variety O
show O
. O

Another O
important O
consideration O
regarding O
Yuan O
dynasty O
arts O
and O
culture O
is O
that O
so O
much O
of O
it O
has O
survived O
in O
China O
, O
relatively O
to O
works O
from O
the O
Tang O
dynasty O
and O
Song O
dynasty O
, O
which O
have O
often O
been O
better O
preserved O
in O
places O
such O
as O
the O
Sh O
s O
in O

in O
Japan O
. O

There O
were O
many O
religions O
practiced O
during O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
, O
such O
as O
Buddhism O
, O
Islam O
, O
and O
Christianity O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
had O
dramatically O
increased O
the O
number O
of O
Muslims O
in O
China O
. O

However O
, O
unlike O
the O
western B-KP
khanates O
, O
the O
Yuan B-KP
dynasty I-KP
never O
converted O
to O
Islam O
. O

Instead O
, O
Kublai O
Khan O
, O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O
, O
favored O
Buddhism B-KP
, I-KP
especially I-KP
the I-KP
Tibetan I-KP
variants I-KP
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
Tibetan B-KP
Buddhism I-KP
was O
established O
as O
the O

The O
top O

known O
as O
the B-KP

of I-KP
Buddhist I-KP

( O
Xuanzheng O

was O
set O
up O
in O
Khanbaliq O
( O
modern O
Beijing O
) O
to O
supervise O
Buddhist O
monks O
throughout O
the O
empire O

Since O
Kublai O
Khan O
only O
esteemed O
the O
Sakya B-KP
sect I-KP
of O
Tibetan O
Buddhism O
, O
other O
religions O
became O
less O
important O
. O

He O
and O
his O
successors O
kept O
a O
Sakya O
Imperial O
Preceptor O
( O
Dishi O

at O

Before O
the O
end O
of O
the O

14 O
leaders O
of O
the O
Sakya O

had O
held O
the O
post O
of O
Imperial O
Preceptor O
, O
thereby O
enjoying O
special O
power O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Mongol O
patronage O
of O
Buddhism O
resulted O
in O
a O
number O
of O
monuments O
of O
Buddhist O
art O
. O

Mongolian O
Buddhist O
translations O
, O
almost O
all O
from O
Tibetan O
originals O

began O
on O
a O
large O
scale O
after O
1300 O

such O
as O
the O
Jalayir O

the O
Oronar O
nobles O
as O

also O
patronized O
Confucian O

A O
considerable O
number O

were O
translated O

Advances O
in O
polynomial B-KP

were O
made O
by O
mathematicians O
during O

The O
mathematician O
Zhu O
Shijie O
( O

solved O
simultaneous O

using O
a O
rectangular O

His O

He O
was O
one O

disseminated O
in O
1281 B-KP
as O
the O
official O

of O
the O

The O

have O
been O

solely O
by O

by O

There O
are O
no O
explicit O

Mongol O

known O
to O
be O
interested O
in O
Muslim O

Mathematical O
knowledge O
from O
the O
Middle O

was O
introduced O
to O
China O
under O
the O
Mongols O
, O
and O
Muslim O
astronomers O
brought O
Arabic O

China O
in O
the O
13th O
century O
. O

The O
physicians O
of O
the O
Yuan O
court O
came O
from O
diverse O
cultures O
. O

Healers O
were O
divided O
into O
non B-KP
Mongol I-KP
physicians I-KP
called O
otachi O
and O
traditional O
Mongol O
shamans O
. O

The O
Mongols O
characterized O
otachi O
doctors O
by O
their O
use O
of O
herbal B-KP
remedies I-KP
, O
which O
was O
distinguished O
from O
the O
spiritual B-KP
cures I-KP
of O
Mongol O
shamanism O
. O

Physicians O
received O
official O
support O
from O
the O
Yuan O

were O
given O
special O
legal O
privileges O

Kublai O
created O
the O
Imperial B-KP
Academy I-KP
of I-KP
Medicine I-KP
to O
manage O
medical O
treatises O
and O
the O
education O
of O
new O
doctors O
. O

Confucian O
scholars O
were O
attracted O
to O
the O
medical O
profession O
because O
it B-KP
ensured I-KP
a I-KP
high I-KP
income I-KP
and I-KP
medical I-KP
ethics I-KP
were I-KP
compatible I-KP
with I-KP
Confucian I-KP
virtues I-KP
. O

The O
Chinese O
medical O
tradition O
of O
the O
Yuan O
had O
`` O
Four B-KP
Great O
Schools O
'' O
that O
the O
Yuan O
inherited B-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
Jin I-KP
dynasty I-KP
. O

All O
four B-KP
schools O
were O
based O
on O
the O
same O
intellectual O
foundation O
, O
but O
advocated O
different O
theoretical O
approaches O
toward O
medicine O
. O

Under B-KP
the I-KP
Mongols I-KP
, O
the O
practice O
of O
Chinese O
medicine O
spread O
to B-KP
other I-KP
parts I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP

Chinese B-KP
physicians I-KP
were I-KP

Several O
medical O

The O

One O
of O
the O
more O
notable O
applications O

was O
the B-KP

The O
Yuan O

used O
woodblocks B-KP

print O

but O
switched O
to O
bronze O

in O
1275 B-KP

The O
Mongols O
experimented O
with O
establishing O
the O
Chinese O
style O
paper O
monetary O
system O
in O
Mongol O
controlled O
territories O
outside O

The O

explained O

of O
Gaykhatu O

The O
Il O
khanate O
government O
issued O
paper O
money O
in O
1294 B-KP
, O
but O
public O
distrust O
of O
the O
exotic O
new O

doomed O
the O
experiment O
. O

Politically O
, O
the O
system O
of O
government O
created O
by O
Kublai O
Khan O
was O
the O
product O
of O
a O
compromise O
between O
Mongolian O
patrimonial B-KP
feudalism I-KP
and O
the O
traditional B-KP
Chinese I-KP
autocratic B-KP
bureaucratic I-KP
system I-KP
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
socially O
the O
educated O
Chinese O
elite O
were O
in O
general O
not O
given O
the O
degree O
of O
esteem O
that O
they O
had O
been O
accorded O
previously O
under O
native O
Chinese O
dynasties O

Although O
the O
traditional O
Chinese O
elite O
were O
not O
given O
their O
share O
of O
power O
, O
the O
Mongols O

the O

the I-KP

) O
largely O
remained O
strangers O
to O
the O
mainstream O
Chinese O
culture O
, O
and O
this O
dichotomy O
gave O
the O
Yuan O
regime O
a O
somewhat B-KP
strong I-KP
`` I-KP
colonial B-KP
'' I-KP
coloration I-KP
. O

The O
unequal O
treatment O
is O
possibly O
due O
to O
the O
fear O
of O
transferring O
power O
to O
the O
ethnic O
Chinese O
under O
their O
rule O
. O

The O
Mongols O
and O
Semuren O
were O
given O
certain O
advantages O
in O
the O
dynasty O
, O
and O
this O
would O
last O
even O
after O
the O
restoration O
of O
the O
imperial O
examination O
in O
the O
early O
14th O
century O
. O

In O
general O
there O
were O
very O
few O
North O

Southerners O

the I-KP

the I-KP

the O
possibility O
that O

so O
in O
the O
Ilkhanate B-KP

Later O
the O
Yongle O
Emperor O
of O
the O
Ming O
dynasty O
also O
mentioned O
the O
discrimination O
that O
existed O
during O
the O
Yuan O
dynasty O

In O
response O
to O
an O
objection O
against O
the O
use O
of O
`` O

'' O
in O
his O
government O
, O
the O
Yongle O
Emperor O
answered O
: O

Many O

that O
the O

that O
the O

not O
an O
indication O

`` O

a O

the O
eukaryotic O

which O
allowed O

Over O
time O
, O
the O
cyanobacterium O
was O
assimilated O
, O
and O
many B-KP
of I-KP
its I-KP
genes I-KP
were I-KP
lost I-KP
or I-KP
transferred I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
nucleus I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP

Some O
of O

synthesized O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
of O
the O
host O
cell O
, O
and O
imported O
back O
into O
the O
chloroplast O
( O
formerly O
the O

. O

These O
chloroplasts O
, O
which O
can O
be O
traced O
back O
directly O
to O
a O
cyanobacterial O
ancestor O
, O
are O
known O
as O
primary O
plastids O
( O
`` O
plastid O
'' O
in O
this O
context O
means O
almost B-KP
the I-KP
same I-KP
thing I-KP
as I-KP
chloroplast B-KP
) O
. O

All O
primary O
chloroplasts O
belong O
to O
one O
of O
three B-KP
chloroplast O
lineages O
the O
glaucophyte O
chloroplast O
lineage O

or O
the O
chloroplastidan O

or O
green B-KP
chloroplast I-KP
lineage I-KP
. O

The O
second O
two O
are O
the O
largest O
, O
and O
the B-KP
green B-KP
chloroplast I-KP
lineage I-KP
is O
the O
one O
that O
contains O
the O
land O
plants O
. O

The O
alga B-KP
Cyanophora O
, O
a O
glaucophyte B-KP
, O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
first O
organisms O
to O
contain O
a O
chloroplast O
. O

The O
glaucophyte B-KP
chloroplast I-KP
group I-KP
is O
the O
smallest O
of O
the O
three O
primary O
chloroplast O
lineages O
, O
being O
found O
in O
only O
13 O
species O
, O
and O
is O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
one O
that O
branched O
off O
the O
earliest O
. O

Glaucophytes O
have O
chloroplasts O
that O
retain O
a O
peptidoglycan O
wall O
between O
their O
double O
membranes O
, O
like O
their O
cyanobacterial O
parent O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
glaucophyte B-KP
chloroplasts I-KP
are O
also O
known O
as O
muroplasts O
. O

Glaucophyte O
chloroplasts O
also O
contain O
concentric O
unstacked O
thylakoids O
, O
which O
surround O
a B-KP
carboxysome B-KP
an O
icosahedral B-KP
structure O
that O
glaucophyte O
chloroplasts O
and O
cyanobacteria O
keep O
their O
carbon O

enzyme O
rubisco O
in O
. O

The O
starch O
that O
they O
synthesize O
collects O
outside O
the O
chloroplast O
. O

Like O
cyanobacteria O
, O
glaucophyte O
chloroplast O
thylakoids O
are O
studded O
with O
light O
collecting O
structures O
called O
phycobilisomes O
. O

For O
these O
reasons O
, O
glaucophyte O
chloroplasts O
are O
considered O
a O
primitive O
intermediate O
between O
cyanobacteria O
and O
the O
more O
evolved O
chloroplasts O
in O
red O
algae O
and O
plants O
. O

Rhodoplasts O
have O
a O
double O
membrane O
with O
an O
intermembrane O
space O
and O
phycobilin B-KP
pigments O
organized O
into O
phycobilisomes B-KP
on O
the O
thylakoid O
membranes O
, O
preventing O
their O
thylakoids O
from O
stacking O
. O

Some O
contain O
pyrenoids O
. O

Rhodoplasts O
have O
chlorophyll B-KP
a I-KP
and I-KP
phycobilins I-KP
for O
photosynthetic O
pigments O
; O
the B-KP
phycobilin B-KP
phycoerytherin I-KP
is O
responsible O
for O
giving O
many O
red O
algae O
their O
distinctive O
red O
color O
. O

However O
, O
since O
they O
also O
contain O
the O
blue O
green O
chlorophyll O
a O
and O
other O
pigments O
, O
many O
are O
reddish O
to O
purple O
from O
the O
combination O
. O

The O
red O
phycoerytherin O
pigment O
is O
an O
adaptation O
to O

red O
algae O
catch B-KP
more I-KP

in I-KP
deep I-KP
water I-KP
as O
such O
, O
some O
red O
algae O
that O
live O
in O
shallow O
water O
have O
less O
phycoerytherin O
in O
their O
rhodoplasts O
, O
and O
can O
appear O
more O
greenish O
. O

Rhodoplasts O
synthesize O
a B-KP
form I-KP
of I-KP
starch I-KP
called O
floridean O
, O
which O
collects O
into O
granules O
outside O
the O
rhodoplast O

in O
the O

of O
the O

The O
chloroplastidan O

are O
another O
large O

Their O
host O
organisms O
are O
commonly O

They O
differ O
from O
glaucophyte O

chloroplasts O
in O
that O
they O
have O
lost O
their O
phycobilisomes B-KP

Most O

Cryptophyte O
chloroplasts O
contain O
a O
nucleomorph B-KP
that O

that O
of O
the O
chlorarachniophytes O
. O

Cryptophyte O
chloroplasts O
have O
four O
membranes O
, O
the O
outermost O
of O

is O
continuous O
with O
the O

Apicomplexans O
are O
another O
group O
of O
chromalveolates B-KP

Like O
the O
helicosproidia B-KP
, O
they O
're O
parasitic O
, O
and O
have O
a O
nonphotosynthetic O
chloroplast O

They O
were O
once O

it O
is O
now O
known O
that O
the O

The O
apicomplexans B-KP
include O
Plasmodium O
, O
the B-KP
malaria B-KP

Many O
apicomplexans O
keep O
a B-KP

called O
an O
apicoplast O

Other O
apicomplexans O
like O
Cryptosporidium O

Apicomplexans O
store O
their O

the O

are O
not O

to O
the O
endoplasmic O

The O
fact O
that O
apicomplexans O
still O
keep O
their O
nonphotosynthetic O
chloroplast O
around O
demonstrates O
how O
the O
chloroplast O
carries O
out O
important O
functions O
other O

Plant O
chloroplasts O
provide O
plant O

This O
makes O
the O
apicoplast O
an O
attractive O
target O
for O
drugs O
to O
cure O
apicomplexan B-KP

The O
most O

is O
isopentenyl B-KP
pyrophosphate I-KP
synthesis I-KP
in O
fact O
, O
apicomplexans O
die O
when O
something O

The O
most O

Peridinin B-KP
is O
not O
found O
in O
any O

The O

Starch O
is O
found O
outside O
the O

An O
important O
feature O
of O
these O
chloroplasts O
is O
that O
their O
chloroplast O
DNA O
is O
highly O
reduced O
and O
fragmented O
into O
many O
small O
circles O

Most O
of O
the O

The O
fucoxanthin B-KP
dinophyte I-KP
lineages O
( O

lost O
their O

and O
replaced O
it O
with O
a O
new O
chloroplast O
derived O
from O
a O
haptophyte O
endosymbiont O
. O

Karlodinium O
and O
Karenia O
probably O
took O
up O
different O
heterokontophytes O
. O

Because O
the O
haptophyte O
chloroplast O
has O
four B-KP
membranes O
, O
tertiary O
endosymbiosis O
would O
be O
expected O
to O
create O
a B-KP
six B-KP

adding O
the O
haptophyte O

the O
dinophyte O

phagosomal O
vacuole O
. O

However O
, O
the O
haptophyte O
was O
heavily O
reduced O
, O
stripped O
of O
a O
few O
membranes O

its O
nucleus O

leaving O
only O
its O
chloroplast O

possibly O
one O

However O
, O
the O
cryptophyte O

not O
an O

only O
the O

seems O
to O
have O
been O

been O
stripped O

, O
leaving O
just O
a B-KP

Cryptophyte O
chloroplasts O
require O
their O
nucleomorph O

maintain O
themselves O
, O
and O
Dinophysis O
species O
grown O
in O
cell O
culture O

can O
not O

so O
it O
is O
possible O
( O

not O
confirmed O
) O
that O
the O
Dinophysis O
chloroplast O
is O
a O
kleptoplast O
if O
so O
, O
Dinophysis O
chloroplasts O
wear O
out O

Dinophysis O
species O

chloroplasts O
to O
replace O
the O
old O

Some O
dinophytes O

The O
mechanism O
for O
chloroplast O
DNA O
( O
cpDNA O
) O
replication O
has O
not O
been O
conclusively O
determined O
, O
but O
two B-KP
main O
models O
have O
been O
proposed O
. O

Scientists O
have O
attempted O
to O
observe O
chloroplast O
replication O
via B-KP
electron B-KP
microscopy I-KP
since O
the O
1970s O
. O

The O
results O
of O
the O
microscopy O
experiments O
led O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
chloroplast O
DNA O
replicates O
using O
a O
double B-KP
displacement I-KP
loop I-KP
( O
D O
loop O
) O
. O

As O
the O
D O
loop O
moves O
through O
the O
circular O
DNA O
, O
it O
adopts O
a B-KP
theta I-KP
intermediary I-KP
form I-KP
, O
also O
known O
as O
a B-KP
Cairns I-KP
replication I-KP
intermediate I-KP
, O
and O
completes O
replication O
with B-KP
a I-KP
rolling I-KP
circle I-KP
mechanism I-KP
. O

Transcription O
starts O
at O
specific O
points O
of O
origin O
. O

Multiple O
replication O
forks O
open O
up O
, O
allowing O
replication O
machinery O
to O
transcribe O
the O
DNA O
. O

As O
replication O
continues O
, O
the O
forks O
grow O
and O
eventually O
converge O
. O

The O
new O
cpDNA O
structures O
separate O
, O
creating O
daughter O
cpDNA O
chromosomes O
. O

In O
cpDNA O
, O
there O
are O
several O
A B-KP
G I-KP
deamination I-KP
gradients I-KP
. O

DNA O
becomes O
susceptible O
to O
deamination O
events O
when B-KP
it I-KP
is I-KP
single I-KP
stranded I-KP
. O

When O
replication B-KP
forks I-KP
form I-KP
, O
the O
strand O
not O
being O
copied O
is O
single O
stranded O
, O
and O
thus O
at O
risk O
for O
A O
G O
deamination O
. O

Therefore O
, O
gradients O
in O
deamination O
indicate O
that O
replication O
forks O
were O
most O
likely O
present O
and O
the O
direction O
that O
they O
initially O
opened O
( O
the O
highest O
gradient O
is O
most O
likely O
nearest O
the O
start O
site O
because O
it O
was O
single O
stranded O
for O
the O
longest O
amount O
of O
time O
) O
. O

This O
mechanism O
is O
still O
the O
leading O
theory O
today O
; O
however O
, O
a O
second O
theory O
suggests O
that O
most O
cpDNA O
is O
actually O
linear B-KP
and O
replicates O
through B-KP
homologous I-KP
recombination I-KP
. O

It O
further O
contends O
that O
only O
a O
minority O
of O
the O
genetic O
material O
is O
kept O
in O
circular O
chromosomes O
while O
the O
rest O
is O
in B-KP
branched I-KP
, I-KP
linear I-KP
, I-KP
or I-KP
other I-KP
complex I-KP
structures I-KP
. O

One O
of O
competing O
model O
for O
cpDNA O
replication O
asserts O
that O
most O
cpDNA O
is O
linear O
and O
participates O
in O
homologous O
recombination O
and O
replication O
structures O
similar O
to O
bacteriophage B-KP
T4 I-KP
. I-KP

It O
has O
been O
established O
that O
some O
plants O
have O
linear B-KP
cpDNA O
, O
such O
as O
maize O
, O
and O
that O
more O
species O
still O
contain O
complex O
structures O
that O
scientists O
do O
not O
yet O
understand O
. O

When O
the O
original O
experiments O
on O
cpDNA O
were O
performed O
, O
scientists O
did O
notice O
linear O
structures O
; O
however O
, O
they O
attributed O
these O
linear O
forms O
to O
broken O
circles O
. O

If O
the O
branched O
and O
complex O
structures O
seen O
in O
cpDNA O
experiments O
are O
real O
and O
not O
artifacts O
of O
concatenated O
circular O
DNA O
or O
broken O
circles O
, O
then O
a O
D O
loop O
mechanism O
of O
replication O
is O
insufficient O
to O
explain O
how O
those O
structures O
would O
replicate O
. O

At O
the O

time O
, O
homologous O
recombination O
does O
not O
expand O
the O
multiple O
A O

G O

seen O
in O

Because O
of O
the O
failure O
to O
explain O
the O
deamination O
gradient O
as O
well O
as O
the O
numerous O
plant O
species O
that O
have O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
circular B-KP
cpDNA O
, O
the O
predominant O
theory O
continues O
to O
hold O
that O
most O
cpDNA O
is O
circular B-KP
and O
most O
likely O
replicates O
via B-KP
a I-KP
D I-KP
loop I-KP
mechanism I-KP

Endosymbiotic B-KP

how O
we O

Even O
if O

For O

now O

, O
the O
presence O
of O
many O
green B-KP
algal I-KP

evidence O
that O
the O
diatom O
ancestor O

probably O
the O

) O
had O
a O
green B-KP

chloroplast I-KP
at O
some O
point O

which O
was O
subsequently O
replaced O

the O

Curiously O
, O
around B-KP
half B-KP
of O
the O
protein O

even O

Many O

A O

work O
in O
the O
mitochondrion O

Some O
transferred O
chloroplast O
DNA O

get O
directed O
to O
the O
secretory O
pathway O
( O
though O
it O

In O
those O
cases O

proteins I-KP
bind I-KP
the I-KP
polypeptide I-KP
, O
keeping B-KP
it I-KP
from I-KP
folding I-KP

This O
is O
important O
because O
it O
prevents B-KP
chloroplast I-KP
proteins I-KP

At O

just O
enough O

that O
they O
can O
be O
recognized O

These O

There O
are O
some O

The O
fact O
that O
chloroplasts O
are O
surrounded B-KP

often O
cited O
as O
evidence O
that O
they O
are O
the O
descendants O
of O
endosymbiotic O
cyanobacteria O
. O

This O
is O
often O
interpreted O
as O
meaning O
the O

is B-KP
the I-KP
product I-KP

not O
true O
both O

the O
cyanobacterium O

The O
chloroplast O

also O
often O

to O
the B-KP

This O

not O
a O

the O

a O

in O
the O

chloroplasts O
use O
an B-KP

a O
problem O
it B-KP
has B-KP
trouble I-KP
distinguishing I-KP

so O
at B-KP
high I-KP

rubisco I-KP
starts I-KP
accidentally I-KP

In O

They O
store O

which O
is O
why O
the O
process O
is O
called O

The O
four O
carbon O

is O
then O
transported O

the O
bundle O

, O
where O
it O
drops O

This O

also O
cause O

This O

These O

such O

Goldbach B-KP

that O

that O
there O

. O

Such O
questions O
spurred O
the O
development O

various O
branches O

, O
focusing O
on O
analytic O

algebraic B-KP
aspects I-KP

Primes O

used O
in O
several O

the O

algebra O

such O

Hence O
, O
6 O

The O

that O

12 O

. O

No O
even O
number O
greater O

prime O
because O
by O
definition O
, O
any O
such O
number O
n O

three O
distinct O
divisors O
, O
namely O
1 B-KP

This O
implies O
that O
n O
is O
not O
prime O
. O

Accordingly O
, O
the O
term O
odd B-KP
prime I-KP
refers O
to O
any O

since O
even B-KP

multiples O

Most O
early O
Greeks O
did O
not O
even O
consider O
1 B-KP
to O
be O
a O
number O
, O
so O
they O
could O
not O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
prime O
. O

By O
the O
Middle O
Ages O
and O
Renaissance O
many O
mathematicians B-KP
included O
1 O
as O
the O
first O
prime O
number O
. O

In O
the O
mid O
18th O
century O
Christian B-KP
Goldbach I-KP
listed O
1 O
as O
the O
first O
prime O
in O
his O
famous O
correspondence O
with O
Leonhard B-KP
Euler I-KP
who O
did O
not O
agree O
. O

In O
the O
19th O
century O
many O
mathematicians O
still O
considered O
the O
number O
1 O
to O
be O
a O
prime O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Derrick O

10,006,721 B-KP

as O
1956 O
, O
started O
with O
1 O
as O
its O
first O
prime O

Henri O
Lebesgue O
is O
said O
to O
be O
the O
last O
professional O
mathematician O
to O
call O
1 O
prime O
. O

By O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
, O
mathematicians O
began O
to O
accept O
that O

a O

rather O
forms O
its B-KP

special I-KP

a B-KP
`` I-KP

A O
large O
body O
of O
mathematical O
work O
would O
still O
be O
valid O
when O
calling O
1 O
a O
prime O
, O
but O
Euclid B-KP

fundamental I-KP
theorem I-KP
of I-KP
arithmetic I-KP
( O
mentioned O
above O
) O
would O
not O
hold O
as O
stated O

For O
example O
, O
the O
number O
15 O
can O
be O
factored O
as O
3 O
5 O
and O
1 O
3 O
5 O
; O
if O
1 O
were O
admitted O
as O
a O
prime O
, O
these O
two O
presentations O
would O
be O
considered O
different O
factorizations O
of O
15 O
into O
prime O
numbers O
, O
so O
the O
statement O
of O
that O
theorem O
would O
have O
to O
be O
modified O
. O

Similarly O
, O
the O
sieve O
of O
Eratosthenes O
would O
not O
work O
correctly O
if B-KP
1 I-KP
were I-KP
considered I-KP
a I-KP
prime I-KP
: O
a O
modified O
version O
of O
the O
sieve O
that O
considers O
1 O
as O
prime O
would O
eliminate B-KP
all I-KP
multiples I-KP
of I-KP
1 I-KP
( I-KP
that I-KP
is I-KP
, I-KP
all I-KP
other I-KP
numbers I-KP
) I-KP
and I-KP
produce I-KP
as I-KP
output I-KP
only I-KP
the I-KP
single I-KP
number I-KP
1 I-KP
. I-KP

Furthermore O
, O
the O
prime O

have O
several O
properties O
that O
the O

such O

In B-KP

Pierre O

Fermat O
stated O
( O

Fermat O

little O
theorem O
( O
later O

The O

The O
most O
basic O
method O
of O
checking O
the O
primality O
of O
a O
given O
integer O
n O
is O
called O
trial B-KP
division I-KP
. O

This O
routine O
consists O
of O
dividing O
n O
by O
each O
integer O
m O
that O
is B-KP
greater I-KP
than I-KP
1 B-KP
and I-KP
less B-KP
than I-KP
or I-KP
equal I-KP
to I-KP
the B-KP
square I-KP
root I-KP
of I-KP
n. I-KP
If I-KP
the O
result O
of O
any O
of O
these O
divisions O
is O
an O
integer O
, O
then O
n O
is O
not O
a O
prime O
, O
otherwise O
it O
is O
a O
prime O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
is O
composite O
( O
with O
a O
and O
b O
1 O
) O
then O
one O
of O
the O
factors O
a O
or O
b O
is O
necessarily O
at O
most O
. O

For O
example O
, O
for O
, O
the O
trial O
divisions O
are O
by O
m O
= O
2 O
, O
3 O
, O
4 O
, O
5 O
, O
and O
6 O
. O

None O
of O
these O
numbers O
divides O
37 O
, O
so O
37 O
is O
prime O
. O

This O
routine O
can O
be O
implemented O
more O
efficiently O
if B-KP
a I-KP
complete I-KP
list I-KP
of I-KP
primes I-KP
up I-KP
to I-KP
is I-KP
known I-KP
then O
trial O
divisions O
need O
to O
be O
checked O
only B-KP
for I-KP
those I-KP
m I-KP
that I-KP
are I-KP
prime I-KP
. O

For O
example O
, O
to O
check O
the O
primality O
of O
37 O
, O
only B-KP
three B-KP
divisions I-KP
are O
necessary O
( O
m O

2 O

given O
that O

Modern O
primality O

for O
general O
numbers O

can O
be O
divided O
into O
two B-KP
main I-KP
classes I-KP
, O
probabilistic B-KP
( I-KP

`` I-KP
Monte I-KP

and O
deterministic B-KP
algorithms I-KP
. O

Deterministic O
algorithms O
provide O
a O
way O
to O
tell O
for O
sure O
whether O
a O
given O
number O
is O
prime O
or O
not O
. O

For O
example O
, O
trial O
division O
is O
a O
deterministic B-KP
algorithm I-KP
because O
, O
if O
performed O
correctly O
, O
it O
will O
always O
identify O
a O
prime O
number O
as O
prime O
and O
a O
composite O
number O
as O
composite O
. O

Probabilistic O
algorithms O
are O
normally O
faster O
, O
but O
do O
not O
completely O
prove O
that O
a O
number O
is O
prime O
. O

These O
tests O
rely O
on O
testing O
a O
given O
number O
in O
a O
partly O
random O
way O
. O

For O
example O
, O
a O
given O
test O
might O
pass O
all O
the O
time O
if O
applied O
to O
a O
prime O
number O
, O
but O
pass O
only O
with O
probability O
p O
if O
applied O
to O
a O
composite O
number O
. O

If O
we O
repeat O
the O
test O
n O
times O
and O
pass O
every O
time O
, O
then O
the O
probability O
that O
our O
number O
is O
composite O
is O
1/ B-KP
( I-KP
1 I-KP
p I-KP
) I-KP
n I-KP
, O
which O
decreases O
exponentially O
with O
the O
number O
of O
tests O
, O
so O
we O
can O
be O
as O
sure O
as O
we O
like O
( O
though O
never O
perfectly O
sure O
) O
that O
the O
number O
is O
prime O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
if O
the O
test O
ever O
fails O
, O
then O
we O
know O
that O
the O
number O
is O
composite O
. O

A O
particularly O
simple O
example O
of O
a O
probabilistic O
test O
is O
the B-KP
Fermat I-KP
primality I-KP
test I-KP
, I-KP
which O
relies O
on O
the B-KP
fact I-KP
( I-KP
Fermat I-KP
's I-KP
little I-KP
theorem I-KP
) I-KP
that I-KP
np I-KP
n I-KP
( I-KP

) I-KP
for I-KP
any I-KP
n I-KP
if I-KP
p I-KP
is I-KP
a I-KP
prime I-KP
number I-KP
. O

If O
we O
have O
a O
number O
b O
that O
we O
want O
to O
test O
for O
primality O
, O
then O
we O
work O
out O
nb O
( O
mod O
b O
) O
for O
a O
random O
value O
of O
n O
as O
our O
test O
. O

A O
flaw O
with O
this O
test O
is O
that O
there O
are O
some O
composite B-KP
numbers I-KP
( I-KP
the I-KP
Carmichael B-KP
numbers I-KP
) I-KP
that O
satisfy O
the O
Fermat O
identity O
even O
though O
they O
are O
not O
prime O
, O
so O
the O
test O
has O
no O
way O
of O
distinguishing O
between O
prime O
numbers O
and O
Carmichael O
numbers O
. O

Carmichael O
numbers O
are O
substantially O
rarer O

From O
Wijk O

the O

, O
the O
shorter O
term O
Rhine B-KP

commonly O
used O

However O
, O
this O

is O
also O
used O
for O
the O
river O
delta O
where O
the O
Rhine O
flows O
into O
Lake O
Constance O
, O
so O
it O
is O
clearer O
to O
call O
the O
larger O
one O
Rhine O
Meuse O

or O
even O
Rhine O
Meuse O
Scheldt O
delta O
, O
as O
the O
Scheldt O
ends O
in O
the O

The O
shape O
of O
the O
Rhine O

is O
determined O
by O
two O
bifurcations O
: O
first O
, O
at O
Millingen O
aan O
de O
Rijn O
, O
the O
Rhine O
splits O

which O
changes O
its O
name O
to O
Nederrijn B-KP
at I-KP
Angeren I-KP
, O
and O
second O
near O
Arnhem O
, O
the O
IJssel O
branches O
off O

A O
sharp O

The O
first O
item O
of O
business O

Wednesdays B-KP
is O
usually O
Time O
for O

for O
up B-KP
to I-KP
four I-KP
minutes I-KP
, O
sharing O
a O
perspective O
on O
issues O
of O
faith O
. O

This O
contrasts O
with O
the O
formal O
style O
of O
`` O
Prayers O
'' O
, O
which O
is O
the O
first O
item O
of O
business O
in O
meetings O
of O
the O
House O
of O
Commons O
. O

Speakers O
are O
drawn O
from O
across O
Scotland O
and O
are O
chosen O
to O
represent O
the B-KP
balance I-KP
of I-KP
religious I-KP
beliefs I-KP
according O
to O
the O
Scottish O
census O
. O

Invitations O

Faith O
groups O
can O
make O
direct O
representations O
to O
the O
Presiding B-KP
Officer I-KP
to O
nominate B-KP
speakers I-KP
. O

The B-KP
Presiding I-KP
Officer I-KP
( O
or O
Deputy O
Presiding O
Officer O
) O
decides O
who O
speaks O
in O
chamber O
debates O
and O
the B-KP
amount I-KP
of I-KP
time I-KP
for I-KP
which I-KP
they I-KP
are I-KP
allowed I-KP
to I-KP
speak I-KP
. O

Normally O
, O
the O
Presiding O
Officer O
tries O
to O
achieve O
a B-KP
balance I-KP
between I-KP
different I-KP
viewpoints I-KP
and I-KP
political I-KP
parties I-KP
when O
selecting O
members O
to O
speak O
. O

Typically O
, O
ministers B-KP
or I-KP
party I-KP
leaders I-KP
open O
debates O
, O
with O
opening O
speakers O
given O
between O
5 O

20 O
minutes O
, O
and O
succeeding O
speakers O
allocated O
less O
time O
. O

The O
Presiding O
Officer O
can O
reduce O
speaking O
time O
if O
a O
large O
number O
of O
members O
wish O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
debate O
. O

Debate O
is O
more O
informal O
than O
in O
some O
parliamentary O
systems O
. O

Members O
may O
call O
each O
other O
directly O
by O
name O
, O
rather O
than O
by O
constituency O
or O
cabinet O
position O
, O
and O
hand O
clapping O
is O
allowed O
. O

Speeches O
to O
the O
chamber O
are O
normally O
delivered O
in O
English O
, O
but O
members O
may O
use O
Scots B-KP
, I-KP
Gaelic I-KP
, I-KP
or I-KP
any I-KP
other I-KP
language I-KP
with I-KP
the I-KP
agreement I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Presiding I-KP
Officer I-KP
. O

The O
Scottish O
Parliament O
has O
conducted O
debates O
in O
the O
Gaelic B-KP
language O
. O

Each O
sitting O
day O
, O
normally O
at O
5 B-KP
pm I-KP
, O
MSPs O
decide O
on O
all O
the O
motions O
and O
amendments O
that O
have O
been O
moved O
that O
day O
. O

This O
`` O
Decision B-KP
Time I-KP
'' O
is O
heralded O
by O
the O
sounding O
of O
the O
division O
bell O
, O
which O
is O
heard O
throughout O
the O
Parliamentary O
campus O
and O
alerts O
MSPs O
who O
are O
not O
in O
the O
chamber O
to O
return O
and O
vote B-KP
. O

At O
Decision O
Time O
, O
the O
Presiding O
Officer O
puts O
questions O
on O
the O
motions O
and O
amendments O
by O
reading O
out O
the O
name O
of O
the O
motion O
or O
amendment O
as O
well O
as O
the O
proposer O
and O
asking O
`` O
Are O
we O
all O
agreed O
? O

`` O
, O
to O
which O
the O
chamber O
first O
votes O
orally O
. O

If O
there O
is O
audible O
dissent O
, O
the O
Presiding O
Officer O
announces O
`` O
There O
will O
be O
a O
division O
'' O
and O
members O
vote O
by O
means O
of O
electronic B-KP
consoles I-KP
on I-KP
their I-KP
desks I-KP
. O

Each O
MSP O
has O
a O
unique O
access O
card O
with O
a O
microchip O
which O
, O
when O
inserted O
into O
the O
console O
, O
identifies O
them O
and O
allows O
them O
to O
vote O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
outcome O
of O
each O
division O
is O
known O
in O
seconds B-KP
. O

The O
outcome B-KP
of I-KP
most I-KP
votes I-KP
can O
be O
predicted O
beforehand O
since O
political B-KP
parties I-KP
normally O
instruct O
members O
which O
way O
to O
vote O
. O

Parties O
entrust O
some O
MSPs O
, O
known O
as O
whips B-KP
, O
with O
the O
task O
of O
ensuring O
that O
party O
members O
vote O
according O
to O
the O
party O
line O
. O

MSPs O
do O
not O
tend O
to O
vote O
against O
such O
instructions O
, O
since O
those O
who O
do O
are O
unlikely O
to O
reach O
higher O
political O
ranks O
in O
their O
parties O
. O

Errant O
members O
can O
be O
deselected B-KP
as I-KP
official I-KP
party I-KP
candidates I-KP
during I-KP
future I-KP
elections I-KP
, O
and O
, O
in O
serious O
cases O
, O
may O
be O
expelled O
from O
their O
parties O
outright O
. O

Thus O
, O
as O
with O
many O
Parliaments O
, O
the O
independence O
of O
Members O
of O
the O
Scottish O
Parliament O
tends O
to O
be O
low O
, O
and O
backbench O
rebellions O
by O
members O
who O
are O
discontent O
with O
their O
party O
's O
policies O
are O
rare O
. O

In O
some O
circumstances O
, O
however O
, O
parties O
announce O
`` O
free O
votes O
'' O
, O
which O
allows O
Members O
to O
vote O
as O
they O
please O
. O

This O
is O
typically O
done O
on O
moral B-KP
issues I-KP
. O

Immediately B-KP
after I-KP
Decision I-KP
Time I-KP
a O
`` O
Members O
Debate O
'' O
is O
held O
, O
which O
lasts O
for O
45 B-KP

of I-KP

The O
role O
of O

is O
stronger B-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
Scottish I-KP
Parliament I-KP
than I-KP
in I-KP
other I-KP

as O

means O
of O
strengthening O
the O

The O
principal B-KP
role I-KP

sovereignty O
, O
the B-KP
Parliament I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
United I-KP

at I-KP
Westminster I-KP
continues O
to O
constitute O

However O
, O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
Scotland O
Act O
, O
Westminster O
agreed O
to O
devolve O
some O
of O
its O

Such O
`` O
devolved O

The O

The O
Scottish B-KP

the O
power O

Another O
of O
the O
roles O
of O

The O

produced O
a O
majority O

making O
this O
the O
first O

in O
the O
Scottish O
Parliament O
where O
a B-KP

has I-KP
commanded I-KP
a I-KP
parliamentary I-KP
majority I-KP

The O

took O
16 O

with O
many O

sufficient O
support O

the O
Scottish O
Parliament O
to O
hold O
a O
referendum O
on O
Scottish B-KP

For O
the B-KP

the O

five B-KP

Annabel B-KP

that O

victory O
but O
vowed O
to O
campaign O

A O
procedural B-KP
consequence I-KP
of O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
Scottish O
Parliament O
is O
that O
Scottish O
MPs O
sitting O

the O
UK O

able B-KP
to I-KP
vote I-KP

only I-KP

England I-KP

whilst O
English O

This O
phenomenon O
is O
known O
as O
the B-KP
West I-KP
Lothian I-KP
question I-KP

has O
led O

Following O

victory O
in O
the O
2015 O
UK O
election O
, O
standing O
orders O

The O
different O
Islamist O
movements O

been O
described O

`` O

between O

: O

one O
end O

a O
strategy O
of O

pole O

The O
movements O

more O
than O

redefining O
`` O
politics O

even O
borders O
'' O
according O
to O
one O
journalist O
( O
Robin O
Wright O
) O
. O

Moderate O
and O
reformist O
Islamists O
who O
accept O
and O
work O
within O
the O
democratic B-KP
process I-KP
include O
parties O
like O
the O
Tunisian O
Ennahda O
Movement O
. O

Jamaat O

Islami O
of O
Pakistan O
is O
basically O
a O
socio O
political O

democratic O

has O
also O
gained O
political O
influence O
through O
military O
coup O

tat O
in O

The O
Islamist O
groups O
like O
Hezbollah O
in O
Lebanon O
and O
Hamas O
in O
Palestine B-KP
participate O
in O
democratic O
and O
political O
process O
as O
well O
as O
armed O
attacks O
, O
seeking O
to O
abolish B-KP
the I-KP
state I-KP
of I-KP
Israel I-KP

Radical O
Islamist O
organizations O

and O
the O
Egyptian O
Islamic O
Jihad O
, O
and O
groups O
such O
as O
the O
Taliban O
, O
entirely O
reject O
democracy B-KP

often O
declaring O

kuffar O
those O

support O
it O
( O

as O

as O
calling O
for O
violent/offensive O
jihad O
or O
urging O
and O
conducting O
attacks O
on O
a O
religious B-KP
basis O
. O

Another O
major B-KP
division B-KP
within O
Islamism O
is O
between O
what O
Graham O
E. O
Fuller O
has O
described O
as O
the O
fundamentalist O
`` O
guardians O
of O
the O
tradition O
'' O
( O
Salafis O
, O
such O
as O
those O
in O
the O
Wahhabi O

and O
the O
`` O
vanguard O
of O
change O
and O
Islamic O
reform O
'' O
centered O
around O
the O
Muslim O
Brotherhood O
. O

Olivier O
Roy O
argues O
that O
`` O
Sunni B-KP
pan I-KP
Islamism I-KP
underwent O
a O
remarkable O
shift O
in O
the O
second O
half O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
'' O
when O
the O
Muslim O
Brotherhood O
movement O
and O
its O
focus O
on O
Islamisation O
of O
pan O
Arabism O
was O
eclipsed O
by O
the O
Salafi O
movement O
with O
its O
emphasis O
on O
`` O
sharia B-KP
rather I-KP
than I-KP
the I-KP
building I-KP
of I-KP
Islamic I-KP
institutions I-KP
, I-KP
'' O
and O
rejection O
of O
Shia O
Islam O
. O

Following O
the O
Arab O
Spring O
, O
Roy O
has O
described O
Islamism O
as O
`` O
increasingly O
interdependent O
'' O
with O
democracy B-KP
in O
much O
of O
the O
Arab O
Muslim O
world O
, O
such O
that O
`` O
neither O
can O
now O
survive O
without O
the O
other O
. O
'' O

While O
Islamist O
political O
culture O
itself O
may O
not O
be O
democratic O
, O
Islamists O
need O
democratic O
elections O
to B-KP
maintain I-KP
their I-KP
legitimacy I-KP
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
their O
popularity O
is O
such O
that O
no O
government O
can O
call O
itself O
democratic O
that O
excludes O
mainstream O
Islamist O
groups O
. O

Islamism B-KP
is O
a O
controversial O
concept O
not O
just O
because O
it O
posits O
a O
political B-KP
role O
for O
Islam O
but O
also O
because O
its B-KP
supporters I-KP
believe O
their O
views O
merely O
reflect O
Islam B-KP
, O
while O
the O
contrary O
idea O
that O
Islam O
is O
, O
or O
can O
be O
, O
apolitical O
is O
an O
error O
. O

Scholars B-KP
and I-KP
observers I-KP
who O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
Islam O
is O
merely O
a O
political O
ideology O
include O
Fred O
Halliday O
, O
John O
Esposito O
and O
Muslim O
intellectuals O
like O
Javed O
Ahmad O
Ghamidi O
. O

Hayri O
Abaza O
argues O
the O
failure O
to O
distinguish O
between O
Islam O
and O
Islamism O
leads O
many O
in O
the O
West O
to O
support O
illiberal B-KP
Islamic I-KP
regimes I-KP
, O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
progressive O
moderates O
who O
seek O
to O
separate O
religion B-KP
from I-KP
politics I-KP
. O

Islamists O
have O
asked O
the O
question O
, O
`` O
If O
Islam O
is O
a O
way O
of O
life O
, O
how O
can O
we O
say O
that O
those O

to O
live O
by O
its O
principles O
in O
legal O
, O
social O
, O
political O
, O
economic O

political O
spheres O

believe O
in O

'' O

Similarly O
, O
a O
writer O
for O
the O
International O
Crisis O
Group O
maintains O
that O
`` O
the O
conception O

a O
creation O
of O

These O
lectures O
dwell O
on O
the O
role O

as O
well O
as O
a O
political O
and O
legal O

the O

Iqbal O
expressed O
fears O
that O
not O

would O
secularism B-KP
and I-KP
secular I-KP
nationalism I-KP
weaken O
the O
spiritual O
foundations O
of O

that O

In O
his O
travels O
to O

, O
he O
promoted O
ideas O

Sir O
Muhammad O
Iqbal O
was O
elected O
president O
of O
the O
Muslim O
League O
in O
1930 B-KP
at O
its O
session O
in O
Allahabad O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
session O
in O
Lahore O
in O
1932 O
. O

In O
his O
Allahabad O
Address O
on O
29 O
December O
1930 O
, O
Iqbal O
outlined O
a O
vision O
of O
an O
independent O
state O
for O
Muslim O
majority O
provinces O
in O
northwestern O
India O
. O

This O
address O
later O
inspired O
the B-KP
Pakistan B-KP
movement I-KP
. O

Sayyid B-KP
Abul I-KP
Ala I-KP
Maududi I-KP
was O
an O
important O
early O
twentieth O
century O
figure O
in O
the O
Islamic O
revival O
in O
India O
, O
and O
then O
after O
independence O
from O
Britain O
, O
in O
Pakistan O
. O

Trained O
as O
a O
lawyer O
he O
chose O
the O
profession O
of O
journalism B-KP
, O
and O
wrote O
about O
contemporary O
issues O
and O
most O
importantly O
about O
Islam O
and O
Islamic O
law O
. O

Maududi O
founded O
the O
Jamaat O
e O
Islami O
party O
in O
1941 B-KP
and O
remained O
its O
leader O
until O
1972 O
. O

However O
, O
Maududi O
had O
much O
more O
impact O
through B-KP
his I-KP
writing B-KP
than O
through O
his O
political O
organising O
. O

His O
extremely O
influential O
books O
( O
translated O
into O
many O
languages O
) O
placed O
Islam O
in B-KP
a B-KP
modern B-KP
context I-KP
, O
and O
influenced O
not O
only O
conservative O
ulema O
but O
liberal O
modernizer O
Islamists O
such O
as O
al O
Faruqi O
, O
whose O
`` O
Islamization O
of O
Knowledge O
'' O
carried O
forward O
some O
of O
Maududi O
's O
key O
principles O
. O

Maududi O
also O
believed O
that O
Muslim O
society O
could O
not O
be O
Islamic O
without O
Sharia B-KP
, O
and O
Islam O
required O
the O
establishment O
of O
an B-KP
Islamic I-KP
state I-KP
. O

This O
state O
should O
be O
a O
`` O
theo O
democracy O
, O
'' O
based O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
: O
tawhid O
( O
unity B-KP
of I-KP
God I-KP
) O
, O
risala O
( O
prophethood O
) O
and O
khilafa O
( O
caliphate O
) O
. O

Although O
Maududi O
talked O
about O
Islamic B-KP
revolution I-KP
, O
by O
`` O
revolution O
'' O
he O
meant O
not O
the O
violence O
or O
populist O
policies O
of O
the O
Iranian O
Revolution O
, O
but O
the O
gradual B-KP
changing O
the O
hearts O
and O
minds O
of O
individuals O
from O
the O
top O
of O
society O
downward O
through O
an B-KP
educational B-KP
process I-KP
or I-KP
da'wah I-KP
. O

Roughly O
contemporaneous O
with O
Maududi O
was O
the O
founding O
of O
the O
Muslim O
Brotherhood O
in O
Ismailiyah B-KP
, I-KP
Egypt B-KP
in O
1928 B-KP
by O
Hassan B-KP
al I-KP
Banna I-KP
. O

His O
was O
arguably O
the O
first O
, O
largest O
and O
most O
influential O
modern O
Islamic O
political/religious O
organization O
. O

Under O
the O
motto O
`` O
the B-KP
Qur'an B-KP
is O
our O
constitution O
, O
'' O
it O
sought O
Islamic O
revival O
through O
preaching O
and O
also O
by O
providing O
basic O
community O
services O
including O
schools O
, O
mosques O
, O
and O
workshops O
. O

Like O
Maududi O
, O
Al O
Banna O
believed O
in O
the O
necessity O
of O
government O
rule O
based O
on O
Shariah O
law O
implemented O
gradually O
and O
by O
persuasion O
, O
and O
of O
eliminating O
all O
imperialist B-KP
influence I-KP
in O
the O
Muslim O
world O
. O

Some O
elements O
of O
the O
Brotherhood O
, O
though O
perhaps O
against O
orders O
, O
did O
engage O
in O
violence B-KP
against O
the O
government O
, O
and O
its O
founder O
Al O
Banna O
was O
assassinated O
in O
1949 B-KP
in O
retaliation O
for O
the O
assassination O
of O
Egypt B-KP
's I-KP
premier I-KP
Mahmud B-KP
Fami I-KP
Naqrashi I-KP

The O
Brotherhood O
has O
suffered O
periodic O
repression O
in O
Egypt O
and O
has O
been O
banned O
several O
times O
, O
in O
1948 B-KP

several O

president O
Gamal B-KP
Abdul I-KP
Nasser I-KP

who O
jailed O
thousands O
of O

for O
several O
years O

Despite O
periodic O
repression O

the O

somewhere B-KP
between I-KP

that O
the O

was O
part O
of O

the O
Western O

The B-KP

maintained O

During B-KP

conflict I-KP
, O
the O
Iranian O

enjoyed O
something O
of O
a O
resurgence O
in O
popularity O
amongst O
the O
predominantly O
Sunni O
`` O

street O
, O
'' O
due O
to O
its O

to O
President B-KP
Mahmoud I-KP

vehement O
opposition O
to O

In O
1979 O
, O
the B-KP
Soviet B-KP
Union I-KP
deployed O
its O
40th O

into O
Afghanistan O
, O
attempting O
to O
suppress O
an B-KP
Islamic B-KP
rebellion I-KP
against I-KP

in O
the O

The O
conflict O
, O
pitting O
indigenous O
impoverished O
Muslims O
( O
mujahideen O
) O
against O
an O
anti O

superpower O
, O
galvanized O
thousands O
of O

around O
the O

to O
send B-KP

sometimes I-KP
to I-KP
go I-KP
themselves I-KP

Leading O
this O
pan O
Islamic O
effort O
was O

While O
the O
military O

Another O
factor O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
that O
worked B-KP
to I-KP
radicalize B-KP
the I-KP
Islamist I-KP
movement I-KP
was O
the O
Gulf O
War O
, O
which O
brought O
several O

to O
put O

to O
Saddam B-KP
Hussein I-KP

occupation O
of O

. O

Prior O
to O
1990 O
Saudi O
Arabia O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
restraining O
the O
many O
Islamist B-KP
groups O
that O
received O
its O
aid O

But O
when O
Saddam O

attacked O
Saudi O
Arabia O
( O
his O

in O
the O

) O
, O
western O
troops O
came O
to O
protect O
the O
Saudi B-KP
monarchy O
. O

Islamists O
accused O
the O
Saudi O
regime O
of O
being O
a O
puppet O
of O
the B-KP
west I-KP
. O

These O
attacks O
resonated O
with O
conservative B-KP
Muslims I-KP

the O
problem O
did O
not O
go O
away O
with O
Saddam O

and O
a O

cooperation O
with O
the O

Saudi O
Arabia O
attempted O
to O
compensate O
for O
its O
loss O
of O
prestige O
among O
these O
groups O
by O
repressing O
those O
domestic B-KP

Imperialism O

has O
on O

often O
through O

The O

Further O
on O

some O

[ O

used O
the O

slightly O

all O

To O
clear O
out O
this O
confusion O
about O
the O
definition O

one O
could O
speak O
of O
`` O
formal B-KP

`` O

the O
first O

implied O

Informal B-KP
rule I-KP
is I-KP
generally I-KP
less I-KP
costly I-KP
than O
taking O
over O

This O
is O
because O
, O
with O
informal B-KP
rule O
, O
the O
control O
is O
spread O
more O
subtly O
through O
technological B-KP
superiority I-KP

The O
greatest O
distinction B-KP
of O
an O
empire O
is O
through O
the O
amount O
of O
land O
that O
a O
nation O
has O
conquered O

A O
distinction O
about O

`` O
that O

subject O
confine O
themselves O

The O
two O
main O
regions O
are O
the O
core O
and O
the O
periphery O

The O
core O
consists O
of O
high O
areas O

the O
periphery O
is O
on O
the O
opposing O
side O
of O
the O
spectrum O
consisting O
of O
areas O
of O
low O
income O
and O
profit O

These O
critical O
theories O
of O
Geo O
politics O
have O
led O
to O
increased O
discussion O
of O
the O
meaning O
and O
impact O
of O
imperialism O
on O
the O
modern O
post O
colonial O
world O
. O

The O
Russian O
leader O
Lenin B-KP
suggested O
that O
`` O
imperialism O
was O
the O
highest O
form O
of O
capitalism O
, O
claiming O
that O
imperialism O
developed O
after O
colonialism O
, O
and O
was O
distinguished O
from O
colonialism O
by O
monopoly O
capitalism O
'' O
. O

This O
idea O
from O
Lenin O
stresses O
how O
important O
new O
political O
world O
order O
has O
become O
in O
our O
modern O
era O
. O

Geopolitics O
now O
focuses O
on O
states O
becoming O
major O
economic O
players O
in O
the O
market O
; O
some O
states O
today O
are O
viewed O
as O
empires B-KP
due O
to O
their O
political O
and O
economic O
authority O
over O
other O
nations O
. O

The O
term O
`` O
imperialism O
'' O
is O
often O
conflated O
with O
`` O
colonialism B-KP
'' O
, O
however O
many O
scholars O
have O
argued O
that O
each O
have O
their O
own O
distinct O
definition O
. O

Imperialism O
and O
colonialism O
have O
been O
used O
in O
order O
to O
describe O
one O
's O
superiority O
, O
domination O
and O
influence O
upon O
a B-KP
person B-KP
or I-KP
group I-KP
of I-KP
people I-KP
. O

Robert O
Young O
writes O
that O
while O
imperialism O
operates O
from O
the O
center O
, O
is O
a O
state O
policy O
and O
is O
developed O
for O
ideological B-KP
as O
well O
as O
financial O
reasons O
, O
colonialism O
is O
simply O
the O
development O
for O
settlement O
or O
commercial B-KP
intentions O
. O

Colonialism O
in O
modern O
usage O
also O
tends O
to O
imply O
a O
degree O
of O
geographic O
separation O
between O
the O
colony O
and O
the O
imperial O
power O
. O

Particularly O
, O
Edward O
Said O
distinguishes O
the O
difference O
between O
imperialism O
and O
colonialism O
by O
stating O
; O
`` O
imperialism O
involved O
'the O
practice O
, O
the O
theory O
and O
the O
attitudes O
of O
a O

, O
while O
colonialism O
refers O
to O
the O
'implanting O

on O
a O
distant O
territory O

' O

Contiguous O
land O
empires O
such O
as O
the O
Russian O
or O
Ottoman B-KP
are O
generally O
excluded O
from O
discussions O
of O
colonialism O
. O

:116 O
Thus O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
imperialism O
includes O
some O
form O
of O
colonialism O
, O
but O
colonialism O
itself O
does O
not O
automatically O
imply O
imperialism O
, O
as O
it O
lacks O
a O
political B-KP
focus I-KP
. O

[ O
further O
explanation O
needed O
] O

Imperialism B-KP
and I-KP
colonialism I-KP
both O
dictate O
the O
political O
and O
economic O
advantage O
over O
a O
land O
and O
the O
indigenous O
populations O
they O
control O
, O
yet O
scholars O
sometimes O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
illustrate O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
. O

Although O
imperialism O
and O
colonialism O
focus O
on O
the O
suppression O
of O
an O
other O
, O
if O
colonialism O
refers O
to O
the B-KP
process I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
country B-KP
taking I-KP
physical I-KP
control I-KP
of I-KP
another I-KP
, O
imperialism O
refers O
to O
the O
political B-KP
and I-KP
monetary I-KP
dominance I-KP
, O
either O
formally O
or O
informally O
. O

Colonialism O
is O
seen O
to O
be O
the O
architect O
deciding O
how O
to O
start O
dominating B-KP
areas I-KP
and O
then O
imperialism O
can O
be O
seen O
as O
creating O
the O
idea O
behind O
conquest O
cooperating O
with O
colonialism O
. O

Colonialism O
is O
when O
the O
imperial O
nation O
begins O
a B-KP
conquest I-KP
over I-KP
an I-KP
area I-KP
and O
then O
eventually O
is O
able O
to O
rule O
over O
the O
areas O
the O
previous O
nation O
had O
controlled O
. O

Colonialism O
's O
core O
meaning O
is O
the B-KP
exploitation B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
valuable I-KP
assets I-KP
and I-KP
supplies I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
nation I-KP
that I-KP
was I-KP
conquered I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
conquering I-KP
nation I-KP
then I-KP
gaining I-KP
the I-KP
benefits I-KP
from O
the O
spoils O
of O
the O
war O
. O

The O
meaning O
of O
imperialism O
is O
to O
create O
an O
empire O
, O
by B-KP
conquering I-KP
the I-KP
other I-KP
state I-KP
's I-KP
lands I-KP
and I-KP
therefore I-KP
increasing I-KP
its I-KP
own I-KP
dominance I-KP
. O

Colonialism O
is O
the O
builder O
and O
preserver O
of O
the O
colonial O
possessions O
in O
an O
area O
by O
a O
population O
coming O
from O
a O
foreign O
region O
. O

Colonialism O
can O
completely O
change O
the O
existing O
social O
structure O
, O
physical O
structure O
and O
economics O
of O
an O
area O
; O
it O
is O
not O
unusual O
that O
the B-KP
characteristics B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
conquering I-KP
peoples I-KP
are O
inherited O
by O
the O
conquered O
indigenous O
populations O
. O

A O
controversial O
aspect O
of O
imperialism O
is B-KP
the I-KP
defense B-KP
and I-KP
justification I-KP
of I-KP
empire I-KP
building I-KP
based I-KP
on I-KP
seemingly I-KP
rational I-KP
grounds I-KP
. O

J O
. O

A. O
Hobson O
identifies O
this O
justification O
on O
general O
grounds O
as O
: O
`` O
It O
is O
desirable O
that O
the O
earth O
should O
be O
peopled O

Many O
others O
argued O
that O
imperialism O
is O
justified O
for O
several O
different O
reasons O
. O

Friedrich O
Ratzel O
believed O
that O
in O
order O
for O
a O
state O
to O
survive O
, O
imperialism B-KP
was O
needed O
. O

Halford O
Mackinder O
felt O
that O
Great O
Britain O
needed O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
greatest O
imperialists O
and O
therefore O
justified O
imperialism O
. O

The O
purportedly O
scientific O
nature O
of O
`` O
Social B-KP
Darwinism I-KP
'' O
and O
a O
theory B-KP
of I-KP
races I-KP
formed O
a O
supposedly O
rational O
justification O
for O
imperialism O
. O

The O
rhetoric O
of O
colonizers O
being O
racially O
superior O
appears O
to O
have O
achieved O
its O
purpose O
, O
for O

throughout O

The O
Royal O
Geographical O

London O

other O
geographical B-KP

According O

allowed O

rather O

British O
imperialism O
often O
used O
the O
concept O
of O
Terra B-KP
nullius I-KP
( O
Latin O
expression O
which O
stems O
from O
Roman O
law O

'empty B-KP

British O
settlement O
and O
colonial O
rule O
of O
the O
continent O
in O
the B-KP
eighteenth B-KP
century I-KP
, I-KP
as O
it O
was O
premised O
on O

nullius O

considered O
it O
unused O

Orientalism O
, O
as O
theorized O
by O
Edward O
Said O
, O
refers O
to O
how O
the O
West O
developed O
an B-KP
imaginative B-KP
geography I-KP
of O
the O
East O
. O

This O
imaginative O
geography O
relies O
on O
an O
essentializing O
discourse O
that O
represents O
neither O
the O
diversity O
nor O
the O
social O
reality O
of O
the O
East O
. O

Rather O
, O
by O
essentializing O
the O
East O
, O
this O
discourse O
uses O
the O
idea O
of O
place O
based O
identities O
to O
create O
difference O
and O
distance O
between O
`` O
we O
'' O
the O
West O
and O
`` O
them B-KP
'' O
the O
East O
, O
or O
`` O
here O
'' O
in O
the O
West O
and O
`` O
there O
'' O
in O
the O
East O
. O

This O
difference O
was O
particularly O
apparent O
in O
textual O
and O
visual O
works O
of O
early O
European O
studies O
of O
the O
Orient O
that O
positioned O
the O
East O
as B-KP
irrational B-KP
and I-KP
backward I-KP
in O
opposition O
to O
the O
rational B-KP
and I-KP
progressive I-KP
West O
. O

Defining B-KP
the I-KP
East I-KP
as I-KP
a I-KP
negative I-KP
vision I-KP
of I-KP
itself I-KP
, O
as O
its B-KP
inferior B-KP
, O
not O
only O
increased O
the O
West O
s O
sense O
of O
self O
, O
but O
also O
was O
a O
way O
of O
ordering O
the O
East O
and O
making O
it O
known O
to O
the O
West O
so O
that O
it O
could O
be O
dominated O
and O
controlled O
. O

The O
discourse O
of O
Orientalism B-KP
therefore O
served O
as O
an O
ideological O
justification O
of O
early O
Western O
imperialism O
, O
as O
it O
formed O
a O
body O
of O
knowledge O
and O
ideas O
that O
rationalized O
social O
, O
cultural O
, O
political O
, O

economic O

Such O
writers O
have O
expanded O
the O
time O
period O

that O
it O

designates O
neither O
a O
policy O

a O
short O
space O

decades O
in O
the O

19th O
century O

a O

As O
the O
application O

shifted O
along O
five O

often O
parallel O
axes O

the O
moral O

the O
economic O
, O
the O
systemic O
, O
the O
cultural O

long O

debated O

The O
concept O
environmental B-KP
determinism I-KP
served O
as O
a O
moral O
justification O
for O
domination O
of O
certain O
territories O
and O
peoples O
. O

It O
was O
believed O
that O
a O
certain O
person O
's O
behaviours O
were O
determined O
by O
the B-KP
environment B-KP
in I-KP
which I-KP
they I-KP
lived I-KP
and O
thus O
validated O
their O
domination O
. O

For O
example O
, O
people O
living O
in O
tropical O
environments O
were O
seen O
as O
`` O
less B-KP
civilized I-KP
'' O
therefore O
justifying O
colonial O
control O
as O
a O
civilizing O
mission O
. O

Across O
the O
three O
waves O
of O
European O
colonialism O
( O
first O
in O
the O
Americas O
, O
second O
in O
Asia O
and O
lastly O
in O
Africa B-KP
) O
, O
environmental O
determinism O
was O
used O
to O
categorically O
place O
indigenous O
people O
in O
a O
racial O
hierarchy O
. O

This O
takes O
two O
forms O
, O
orientalism B-KP
and I-KP
tropicality I-KP
. I-KP

According O
to O
geographic B-KP
scholars I-KP
under O
colonizing B-KP
empires I-KP
, O
the O
world O
could O
be O
split O
into O
climatic O
zones O
. O

These O
scholars O
believed O
that O
Northern B-KP
Europe I-KP
and I-KP
the I-KP
Mid I-KP
Atlantic I-KP
temperate O
climate O
produced O
a O
hard O
working O
, O
moral O
, O
and O
upstanding O
human O
being O
. O

Alternatively O
, O
tropical O
climates O
yielded O
lazy O
attitudes O
, O
sexual O
promiscuity O
, O
exotic O
culture O
, O
and O
moral O
degeneracy O
. O

The O
people O
of O
these O
climates O
were O
believed O
to O
be O
in O
need O
of O
guidance B-KP
and I-KP
intervention I-KP
from O
the O
European O
empire O
to O
aid O
in O
the O
governing O
of O
a O
more O
evolved O
social O
structure O
; O
they O
were O
seen O
as O
incapable O
of O
such O
a O
feat O
. O

Similarly O
, O
orientalism B-KP
is O
a O
view O
of O
a O
people O
based O
on O
their O
geographical O
location O

With O

In O

announced O

Although O
the O

critics O
argue O
that O
it O
exhibited O
tendencies O

Some O
scholars O
hold O
that O
the O
Soviet O

was O
a O
hybrid O
entity O
containing O
elements O
common O
to O
both O
multinational O
empires O
and O
nation O

It O
has O
also O
been O
argued O
that O
the O
USSR O
practiced O
colonialism O
as O

was O
carrying O
on O
the O
old O
Russian O

The O

a O

were O
more O

This O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O

of O

In O
1898 O
, O

The O
point O

did O
, O
but O
the O
anti O

presence O
was O

less O

The O
United O

Church O
understands O
itself O
to O

part O
of O
the B-KP
holy B-KP
catholic I-KP
( I-KP
or I-KP

it O
recognizes O
the O
historic O
ecumenical O
creeds O

the O
Apostle O

and O
the O
Nicene O
Creed O
; O
which O
are O
used O
frequently O
in O
services O

. B-KP
The I-KP
Book B-KP
of I-KP

also O
recognizes O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
Chalcedonian O
Creed O
of O
the O
Council O
of O
Chalcedon O
. O

It O
upholds O
the O
concept O
of O
the O
`` O
visible O
and O
invisible O
Church O
, O
'' O
meaning B-KP
that I-KP
all B-KP
who I-KP
are I-KP
truly I-KP
believers I-KP
in I-KP
every I-KP
age I-KP
belong I-KP
to I-KP
the I-KP
holy I-KP
Church I-KP
invisible I-KP
, I-KP
while I-KP
the I-KP
United I-KP
Methodist I-KP
Church I-KP
is I-KP
a I-KP
branch I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
Church I-KP
visible I-KP

to O
which O
all O

the O
only O
institution O
wherein O
the O
Word O
of O
God O
is O
preached O
and O
the O

are O
administered O
. O

Some O
argue O
that O
The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
can O
lay O
a O
claim O
on O
apostolic O
succession O
, O
as O
understood O
in O
the O
traditional O
sense O
. O

As B-KP
a I-KP
result I-KP
of I-KP
the B-KP
American I-KP
Revolution I-KP
, I-KP
John O
Wesley O
was O
compelled O
in O
1784 O
to O
break O
with O
standard O
practice O
and O
ordain O
two O
of O
his O
lay O
preachers O
as O
presbyters O
, O
Thomas B-KP
Vasey I-KP
and I-KP
Richard I-KP
Whatcoat I-KP
. I-KP

Dr. B-KP
Thomas I-KP
Coke I-KP
, O
already O
an O
Anglican O
priest O
, O
assisted O
Wesley O
in O
this O
action O
. O

Coke O
was O
then O
`` O
set O
apart O
'' O
as O
a O
superintendent O
( O
bishop O
) O
by O
Wesley O
and O
dispatched O
with O
Vasey O
and O
Whatcoat O
to O
America O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
Methodist O
activities O
there O
. O

In O
defense O
of O
his O
action O
to O
ordain O
, O
Wesley O
himself O
cited O
an O
ancient O
opinion O
from O
the O
Church O
of O
Alexandria O
, O
which O
held O
that O
bishops O
and O
presbyters O
constituted O
one O
order O
and O
therefore O
, O
bishops O
are O
to O
be O
elected O
from O
and O
by O
the O
presbyterate O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
for O
two O
centuries O
the O
succession O
of O
bishops O
in O
the O
Church O
of O
Alexandria O
was O
preserved O
through O
ordination O
by O
presbyters O
alone O
and O
was O
considered O
valid O
by O
the O
ancient O
church O
. O

Methodists O
today O
who O
would O
argue O
for O
apostolic O
succession O
would O
do O
so O
on O
these O
grounds O
. O

While O
many O
United O
Methodist O
congregations O
operate O
in O
the O
evangelical O
tradition O
, O
others O
reflect O
the O
mainline O
Protestant O
traditions O
. O

Although O
United O
Methodist O
practices O
and O
interpretation O
of O
beliefs O
have O
evolved O
over O
time O
, O
these O
practices O
and O
beliefs O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
the O
writings O
of O
the O
church O
's O
founders O
, O
especially O
John B-KP
Wesley I-KP
and I-KP
Charles I-KP
Wesley I-KP

C. I-KP
Outler I-KP

the O

Outler O

work O
proved O
pivotal O
in O

Prevenient B-KP
grace I-KP
, I-KP
or O
the B-KP
grace I-KP
that I-KP
`` I-KP
goes I-KP
before I-KP
'' I-KP
us I-KP
, O
is O
given O
to O
all O
people O
. O

It B-KP
is I-KP
that B-KP
power I-KP
which I-KP
enables I-KP
us I-KP
to I-KP
love I-KP
and I-KP
motivates I-KP
us I-KP
to I-KP
seek I-KP
a I-KP
relationship I-KP
with I-KP
God I-KP
through I-KP
Jesus I-KP
Christ I-KP
. I-KP

This O
grace O
is O
the O
present O
work O
of O
God B-KP
to O
turn O
us O
from O
our O
sin B-KP
corrupted O
human O
will O
to O
the O
loving O
will O
of O
the O
Father O
. O

In O
this O
work O
, O
God O
desires O
that O
we O
might O
sense O
both O
our O
sinfulness O
before O
God O
and O
God O
's O
offer O
of O
salvation O
. O

Prevenient B-KP
grace I-KP
allows O
those O
tainted O
by O
sin B-KP
to O
nevertheless O
make O
a O
truly O
free O
choice O
to O
accept O
or O
reject O
God O
's O
salvation O
in O
Christ O
. O

Justifying B-KP
Grace I-KP
or I-KP
Accepting I-KP
Grace I-KP
is O
that O
grace O
, O
offered O
by O
God O
to O
all O
people O
, O
that O
we O
receive O
by O
faith O
and O
trust O
in O
Christ O
, O
through O
which O
God O
pardons O
the O
believer O
of O
sin O
. O

It O
is O
in O
justifying O
grace O
we O
are O
received O
by O
God O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
our O
sin O
. O

In O
this O
reception O
, O
we O
are O
forgiven O
through O
the O
atoning O
work O
of O
Jesus O
Christ O
on O
the O
cross O
. O

The B-KP
justifying B-KP
grace I-KP
cancels O
our O
guilt O
and O
empowers O
us O
to O
resist O
the O
power O
of O
sin O
and O
to O
fully O
love O
God O
and O
neighbor O
. O

Today O
, O
justifying B-KP
grace I-KP
is O
also O
known O
as O
conversion B-KP
, I-KP
`` I-KP
accepting I-KP
Jesus I-KP
as I-KP
your I-KP

John B-KP
Wesley I-KP
originally I-KP
called I-KP
this I-KP
experience I-KP
the I-KP
New B-KP
Birth I-KP
. I-KP

This O
experience O
can O
occur O
in O
different O
ways O
; O
it O
can O
be O
one O
transforming O
moment O
, O
such O
as O
an O
altar O

Sanctifying B-KP
Grace I-KP
is B-KP
that B-KP
grace I-KP
of I-KP
God I-KP
which I-KP
sustains I-KP
the I-KP
believers I-KP
in I-KP
the I-KP
journey I-KP
toward I-KP
Christian B-KP
Perfection I-KP
: O
a B-KP
genuine I-KP
love I-KP
of I-KP
God I-KP
with I-KP
heart I-KP
, I-KP
soul I-KP
, I-KP
mind I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
strength I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
a I-KP
genuine I-KP
love I-KP
of I-KP
our I-KP
neighbors I-KP
as I-KP
ourselves I-KP
. O

Sanctifying O
grace O
enables O
us O
to O
respond O
to O
God O
by O
leading B-KP
a I-KP
Spirit I-KP
filled I-KP
and I-KP
Christ I-KP
like I-KP
life I-KP
aimed I-KP
toward I-KP
love I-KP
. O

Wesley O
never O
claimed O
this O
state O
of O
perfection O
for O
himself O
but O
instead O
insisted O
the O
attainment O
of O
perfection O
was O
possible O
for O
all O
Christians O
. O

Here O
the O
English O
Reformer O
parted O
company O
with O
both O
Luther O
and O
Calvin O
, O
who O
denied O
that O
a O
man O
would O
ever O
reach O
a O
state O
in O
this O
life O
in O
which O
he O
could O
not O
fall O
into O
sin O
. O

Such O
a O
man O
can O
lose O
all O
inclination O
to O
evil O
and O
can O
gain O
perfection O
in O
this O
life O
. O

Wesleyan B-KP
theology I-KP
stands I-KP
at O
a O
unique O
cross O
roads O
between O
evangelical O
and O
sacramental O
, O
between O
liturgical O
and O
charismatic O
, O
and O
between O
Anglo O
Catholic O
and O
Reformed O
theology O
and O
practice O
. O

It O
has O
been O
characterized O
as O
Arminian O
theology O
with O
an O
emphasis O
on O
the O
work O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
to O
bring O
holiness O
into O
the O
life O
of O
the O
participating O
believer O
. O

The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
believes O
in O
prima B-KP
scriptura I-KP
, O
seeing O
the O
Holy O
Bible O
as O
the O
primary O
authority O
in O
the O
Church O
and O
using O
sacred O
tradition O
, O
reason O
, O
and O
experience O
to O
interpret O
it O
, O
with O
the O
aid O
of O
the O
Holy O
Spirit O
( O
see O
Wesleyan O
Quadrilateral O
) O
. O

Therefore O
, O
according O
to O
The B-KP
Book I-KP
of I-KP
Discipline I-KP
, O
United O
Methodist O
theology O
is O
at O
once O
`` O
catholic O
, O
evangelical O
, O
and O
reformed O
. O
'' O

Today O
, O
the B-KP
UMC I-KP
is O
generally O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
more O
moderate O
and O
tolerant O
denominations O
with O
respect O
to O
race O
, O
gender O
, O
and O
ideology O
, O
though O
the O
denomination O
itself O
actually O
includes O
a O
very O
wide O
spectrum O
of O
attitudes O
. O

Comparatively O
, O
the O
UMC O
stands O
to O
the O
right O
of O
liberal O
and O
progressive O
Protestant O
groups O
such O
as O
the O
United O
Church O
of O
Christ O
and O
the O
Episcopal O
Church O
on O
certain O
issues O
( O
especially O
regarding O
sexuality O
) O
, O
but O
to O
the O
left O
of O
historically O
conservative O
evangelical O
traditions O
such O
as O
the O
Southern O
Baptists O
and O
Pentecostalism O
, O
in O
regard O
to O
theological O
matters O
such O
as O
social O
justice O
and O
Biblical O
interpretation O
. O

However O
, O
it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
the O
UMC O
is O
made O
up O
of O
a O
broad O
diversity O
of O
thought O
, O
and O
so O
there O
are O
many O
clergy O
and O
laity O
within O
the O
UMC O
that O
hold O
differing O
viewpoints O
on O
such O
theological O
matters O
. O

The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
upholds O
the O
sanctity O
of O
human O
life O
both O
of O
the O
child O
and O
the O
mother O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
church O
is O
`` O
reluctant O
to O
affirm O
abortion O
as O
an O
acceptable O
practice O
, O
'' O
and O
condemns O
the O
use O
of O
late O
term O
or O
partial O
birth O
abortion O
except O
as O
a O
medical O
necessity O
. O

The O
denomination O
as O
a O

is O
committed O
to O
`` O

the O

Historically O
, O
the O
Methodist O
Church O
has O
supported O
the B-KP
temperance I-KP
movement I-KP
. I-KP

John O
Wesley O
warned O
against O
the O
dangers O
of O
drinking O
in O
his O
famous O
sermon O
, O
`` O
The B-KP
Use I-KP
of I-KP
Money I-KP
, I-KP
'' O
and O
in O
his O
letter O
to O
an O
alcoholic O
. O

At O
one O
time O
, O
Methodist O
ministers O
had O
to O
take O
a O
pledge O
not O
to O
drink O
and O
encouraged O
their O
congregations O
to O
do O
the O
same O
. O

Today O
the O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
states O
that O
it O
`` O
affirms O
our O
long O
standing O
support O
of O
abstinence O
from O
alcohol O
as O
a O
faithful O
witness O
to O
God O
's O
liberating O
and O
redeeming O
love O
for O
persons O
. O
'' O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
uses B-KP
unfermented B-KP
grape I-KP
juice I-KP
in O
the O
sacrament O
of O
Holy O
Communion O
, O
thus O
`` O
expressing O
pastoral O
concern O
for O
recovering O
alcoholics O
, O
enabling O
the O
participation O
of O
children O
and O
youth O
, O
and O
supporting O
the O
church O
's O
witness O
of O
abstinence O

'' O

Moreover O
, O
in B-KP
2011 B-KP
and I-KP
2012 I-KP
, O
The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
's O
General O
Board O
of O
Church O
and O
Society O
called O
on O
all O
United O
Methodists O
to O
abstain O
from O
alcohol O
for O
Lent O
. O

The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
, O
along O
with O
other O
Methodist O
churches O
, O
condemns O
capital B-KP
punishment I-KP
, O
saying O
that O
it O
can O
not O
accept O
retribution O
or O
social O
vengeance O
as O
a O
reason O
for O
taking O
human O
life O
. O

The O
Church O
also O
holds O
that O
the O
death O
penalty O
falls O
unfairly O
and O
unequally O
upon O
marginalized O
persons O
including O
the O
poor O
, O
the O
uneducated O
, O
ethnic O
and O
religious O
minorities O
, O
and O
persons O
with O
mental O
and O
emotional O
illnesses O
. O

The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
also O
believes O
that O
Jesus O
explicitly O
repudiated O
the O
lex O
talionis O
in O
Matthew B-KP
5:38 I-KP
39 I-KP
and O
abolished O
the O
death O
penalty O
in O
John B-KP
8:7 I-KP
. I-KP

The B-KP
General I-KP
Conference I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
United I-KP
Methodist I-KP
Church I-KP
calls O
for O
its O
bishops O
to O
uphold O
opposition O
to O
capital O
punishment O
and O
for O
governments O
to O
enact O
an O
immediate O
moratorium O
on O
carrying O
out O
the O
death O
penalty O
sentence O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
prohibits B-KP
the I-KP
celebration I-KP
of I-KP
same B-KP
sex I-KP
unions I-KP
. I-KP

Rev O
. O

Jimmy O
Creech O
was O
defrocked O
after O
a O
highly O
publicized O
church O
trial O
in O
1999 B-KP
on O
account O
of O
his O
participation O
in O
same O
sex O
union O
ceremonies O
. O

It O
forbids O
any O
United O
Methodist O
board O
, O
agency O
, O
committee O
, O
commission O
, O
or O
council O
to O
give O
United O
Methodist O
funds O
to O
any O
gay O
organization O
or O
group O
, O
or O
otherwise O
use O
such O
funds O
to O
promote O
the O
acceptance O
of O
homosexuality O
. O

Other O
ministers O
have O
been O
defrocked O
for O
officiating O
at O
same O
sex O
weddings O
and O
several O
trials O
of O
others O
are O
scheduled O
. O

Still O
, O
some O
congregations O
have O
sought O
other O
ways O
to O
recognize O
same O
sex O
couples O
. O

For O
example O
, O
one O
congregation O
hosted O
a O
proposal O
for O
a O
same O
sex O
couple O
announcing O
their O
engagement O
. O

Moreover O
, O
some O
churches O
, O
especially O
in O
2016 B-KP
after O
same O
sex O
marriage O
was O
legalized O
nationwide O
, O
have O
provided O
blessings O
for O
same O
sex O
marriages O
. O

In O
April O
of O
2016 O
, O
a O
United O
Methodist O
bishop O
made O
a O
bold O
statement O
by O
performing O
a O
same O
sex O
marriage O
in O
church O
as O
a O
clear O
sign O
of O
his O
advocacy O
for O
change O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
`` O
implore O
[ O
s O
] O
families O
and O
churches O
not O
to O
reject O
or O
condemn O
lesbian O
and O
gay O
members O
and O
friends O
'' O
and O
commits O
itself O
to O
be O
in O
ministry O
with O
all O
persons O
, O
affirming O
that O
God O
's O
grace O
, O
love O
, O
and O
forgiveness O
is O
available O
to O
all O
. O

Additionally O
, O
many O
organizations O
, O
conferences O
, O
and O
congregations O
have O
recently O
called O
for O
broader O
acceptance O
of O
the O
LGBT B-KP
community I-KP
within O
the O
UMC O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the B-KP
Connectional I-KP
Table I-KP
, O
a O
governing O
committee O
, O
has O
voted O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
proposal O
that O
calls O
for O
a O
localized O
option O
, O
which O
would O
permit B-KP
ministers I-KP
to I-KP
officiate I-KP
same I-KP
sex I-KP
weddings I-KP
, O
and O
it O
would O
allow O
conferences O
to O
ordain O
gay O
clergy O
. O

Moreover O
, O
many O
conferences O
have O
taken O
a O
position O
by O
voting O
in O
favor O
of O
same B-KP
gender I-KP
marriages I-KP
with I-KP
resolutions I-KP
. O

In O
1987 B-KP
, O
a O
United O
Methodist O
church O
court O
in O
New O
Hampshire O
defrocked O
Methodist O
minister O
Rose O
Mary O
Denman O
for O
openly O
living O
with O
a O
same O
sex O
partner O
. O

In O
2005 B-KP
, O
clergy O
credentials O
were O
removed O
from O
Irene O
Elizabeth O
Stroud O
after O
she O
was O
convicted O
in O
a O
church O
trial O
of O
violating O
church O
law O
by O
engaging O
in O
a O
lesbian O
relationship O
; O
this O
conviction O
was O
later O
upheld O
by O
the O
Judicial O
Council O
, O
the O
highest O
court O
in O
the O
denomination O
. O

The O
Judicial O
Council O
also O
affirmed O
that O
a O
Virginia O
pastor O
had O
the O
right O
to O
deny O
local O
church O
membership O
to O
a O
man O
in O
an O
openly O
gay O
relationship O
. O

This O
affirmation O
, O
however O
, O
was O
based O
upon O
a O
senior O
pastor O
's O
right O
to O
judge O
the O
readiness O
of O
a O
congregant O
to O
join O
as O
a O
full O
member O
of O
the O
church O
. O

However O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
UMC O
Judicial O
Council O
, O
in O
2008 O
, O
ruled O
that O
conferences O
can O
determine O
their O
own O
policy O
related O
to O
transgender O
pastors O
, O
and O
therefore O
some O
regional O
conferences O
have O
voted O
to O
recognize O
ordained O
transgender O
pastors O
. O

The B-KP
Baltimore I-KP
Washington I-KP
Conference I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
UMC I-KP
has O
approved O
the O
appointment O
of O
an O
openly O

the O
provisional O

. O

The O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
opposes O
conscription B-KP
as O
incompatible O
with O
the O
teaching O
of O
Scripture O
. O

Therefore O
, O
the O
Church O
supports O
and O
extends O
its O
ministry O
to O
those O
persons B-KP
who I-KP
conscientiously I-KP
oppose I-KP
all B-KP
war B-KP
, O
or O
any O
particular O
war O
, O
and O
who O
therefore O
refuse O
to O
serve O
in O
the O
armed O
forces O
or O
to O
cooperate O
with O
systems O
of O
military O
conscription O
. O

However O
, O
the O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
also O
supports O
and O
extends O
its O
ministry O
to O
those O
persons O
who O
conscientiously O
choose O
to O
serve O
in O
the O
armed O
forces O
or O
to O
accept O
alternative O
service O
. O

The O
church O
also O
states O
that O
`` O
as O
Christians O
they O
are O
aware O
that O
neither O
the B-KP
way I-KP
of I-KP
military B-KP
action I-KP

nor O
the O
way O

is O
always O
righteous O

'' O

The O
United O

Church O
maintains O
that O
war O
is B-KP
incompatible I-KP
with I-KP
Christ B-KP
's I-KP
message I-KP
and I-KP
teachings I-KP
. I-KP

Therefore O
, O
the O
Church O
rejects O
war B-KP
as O
an O
instrument B-KP
of I-KP
national B-KP
foreign I-KP
policy I-KP
, O
to O
be O
employed O
only O
as O
a O
last O
resort O
in O
the O
prevention O
of O
such O
evils B-KP
as I-KP
genocide I-KP
, I-KP
brutal I-KP
suppression I-KP
of I-KP
human I-KP
rights I-KP
, I-KP
and I-KP
unprovoked I-KP
international I-KP
aggression I-KP
. O

It O
insists O
that O
the O
first O
moral O
duty O
of O
all O
nations O
is O
to O
resolve O
by O
peaceful O
means O
every O
dispute O
that O
arises O
between O
or O
among O
them O
; O
that O
human O
values O
must O
outweigh O
military O
claims O
as O
governments O
determine O
their O
priorities O
; O
that O
the O
militarization O
of O
society O
must O
be O
challenged O
and O
stopped O
; O
that O
the O
manufacture O
, O
sale O
, O
and O
deployment O
of O

must O
be O
reduced O

controlled O
; O
and O
that O
the O
production O

possession O
, O
or O

be O
condemned O

Consequently O
, O
the O
United O
Methodist O
Church O
endorses O
general B-KP

complete I-KP
disarmament I-KP
under O
strict O
and O
effective O
international O
control O

The O
United O

reportedly O
split O

by O
Tanaghrisson O
with O
a O

. O

The O
historian O
Fred O
Anderson O
suggests O
that O
Tanaghrisson O
was O
acting O
to B-KP
gain I-KP
the I-KP
support I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
British I-KP

After O
several O

the O

decided O
to O
send O
an O
army O

to O
dislodge B-KP
the I-KP

They O
chose O
Major O

lead O
the O

Word O

the O

Braddock I-KP

departure I-KP

In O
response O
, O
King O
Louis O

dispatched B-KP
six I-KP

the I-KP

The O
British O
, O
intending O
to O
blockade B-KP

sent I-KP
out I-KP
their I-KP

in I-KP
February I-KP

the O
French O
fleet O

detached O
a O
fast O

North O
America O
in O
an O
attempt O

intercept O
the O
French O

An O
early O
important O
political O
response O
to O
the B-KP
opening I-KP

was O
the O
convening O
of O
the O
Albany B-KP
Congress I-KP
in O
June O

July O
, O
1754 O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
congress O
was O
to B-KP
formalize I-KP
a I-KP
unified I-KP
front I-KP
in I-KP
trade I-KP

negotiations I-KP
with I-KP
various I-KP

seen I-KP
to I-KP
be I-KP
pivotal I-KP
in O
the O
success O
in O
the O
war O
that O

unfolding O
. O

The B-KP
plan I-KP
that I-KP
the I-KP

never I-KP
ratified I-KP

the O
format B-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
congress I-KP
and I-KP
many I-KP
specifics I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
plan I-KP

In O

he O
began O
organizing O

He O
was O

ordered O

the O
Secretary O

the O
expedition O
was O
finally O
ready O
to O
sail O
from O
Halifax O

Nova O

in O
early O
August O

In O
the O

Faced O
with O
this O
strength O
, O
Loudoun O
returned B-KP

news I-KP
that I-KP

harassed O
Fort O
William O

the O
first O
half O
of O
1757 O
. O

In O
January O
they O
ambushed O
British O
rangers O
near O
Ticonderoga O

In O
February O
they O
launched O
a O
daring O
raid O
against O
the O

across O
the O
frozen O
Lake B-KP
George I-KP
, O
destroying O
storehouses O

buildings O
outside O
the O

In O
early O
August O
, O
Montcalm O

7,000 O
troops O
besieged O
the O
fort O

which O
capitulated O
with O
an O
agreement O

When O
the O
withdrawal O
began O
, O
some O

The O
aftermath O
of O
the O
siege O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
transmission O
of O
smallpox O
into O
remote O
Indian O
populations O
; O
as O
some O
Indians O
were O
reported O
to O
have O
traveled O
from O
beyond O
the O
Mississippi O

participate O
in O
the O
campaign O

returned O
afterward O
having O
been O
exposed O
to O
European O
carriers O

Vaudreuil O

Montcalm O
were O
minimally O
resupplied O
in O
1758 O
, O
as O
the O
British B-KP
blockade I-KP

the I-KP
French I-KP
coastline I-KP
limited I-KP
French I-KP
shipping I-KP

The O
situation O
in O
New O
France O
was O
further O
exacerbated O
by O
a B-KP
poor I-KP
harvest I-KP
in I-KP
1757 I-KP
, O
a O
difficult O
winter O
, O
and O
the O
allegedly B-KP
corrupt I-KP
machinations I-KP
of I-KP
Fran I-KP
ois I-KP
Bigot I-KP
, O
the O
intendant O
of O
the O
territory O
. O

His O
schemes O
to O
supply O
the O
colony O
inflated O
prices O
and O
were O
believed O
by O
Montcalm O
to O
line O
his O
pockets O
and O
those O
of O
his O
associates O
. O

A O
massive O
outbreak O
of O
smallpox O
among O
western O
tribes O
led O
many O
of O
them O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
trading O
in O
1758 O
. O

While O
many O
parties O
to O
the O
conflict O
blamed O
others O
( O
the O
Indians O
blamed O
the O
French O
for O
bringing O
`` O
bad O
medicine O
'' O
as O
well O
as O
denying O
them O
prizes O
at O
Fort O

, O
the O
disease O
was O
probably O
spread O
through O
the O
crowded O
conditions O
at O
William O
Henry O
after O
the O
battle O

Montcalm O
focused O
his O
meager O

on O
the B-KP

a O
continuation O

embarked O
on O
a O

The O

the O
Battle O

The O

the O

Philosophers O
in O
antiquity O
used O
the B-KP
concept I-KP
of I-KP
force B-KP
in O
the O
study O
of O
stationary O

moving O
objects O

simple O

but O
thinkers O
such O
as O
Aristotle O
and O
Archimedes O
retained O
fundamental O
errors O
in O
understanding O
force O
. O

In O
part O
this O
was O
due O
to O
an O
incomplete O
understanding O
of O
the O
sometimes O
non O
obvious O
force O
of O
friction O
, O
and O
a O
consequently O
inadequate O
view O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
natural O
motion O
. O

A B-KP
fundamental I-KP
error I-KP
was O
the O
belief O
that O
a O
force O
is O
required O
to O
maintain O
motion O
, O
even O
at O
a O
constant O
velocity O

Most O
of O
the O
previous O
misunderstandings O
about O
motion O

force O
were O
eventually O
corrected O
by O
Galileo O
Galilei O
and O
Sir O
Isaac O
Newton O

With O
his O
mathematical O
insight O
, O
Sir B-KP
Isaac I-KP
Newton I-KP
formulated O
laws O
of O
motion O
that O
were O
not O
improved O
on O
for O
nearly B-KP
three B-KP
hundred I-KP
years I-KP
. O

By O
the O
early O
20th O
century O
, O
Einstein B-KP
developed O
a O
theory O
of O
relativity O
that O
correctly O
predicted O
the O
action O
of O
forces O
on O
objects O
with O
increasing O
momenta O
near O
the O
speed O
of O
light O
, O
and O
also O
provided O
insight O
into O
the O
forces O
produced O
by O
gravitation O
and O
inertia O

With O
modern O
insights O
into O
quantum O

technology O
that O
can O
accelerate O
particles O
close O
to O
the O
speed O

physics O
has O
devised O
a B-KP
Standard I-KP
Model I-KP
to O
describe O
forces O

The O
Standard O

the O

Aristotle B-KP
provided O
a O
philosophical O
discussion O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
a O
force O
as O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
Aristotelian B-KP
cosmology I-KP
. O

In O
Aristotle O
's O
view O
, O
the O
terrestrial O
sphere O
contained O
four B-KP
elements O
that O
come O
to O
rest O
at O
different O
`` O
natural O
places O
'' O
therein O
. O

Aristotle O
believed O
that O
motionless O
objects O
on O
Earth O
, O
those O
composed O
mostly O
of O
the O
elements O
earth O
and O
water O
, O
to O
be O
in O
their O
natural O
place O
on B-KP
the I-KP
ground I-KP
and O
that O
they O
will O
stay O
that O
way O
if O
left O
alone O
. O

He O
distinguished O
between O
the O
innate O
tendency O
of O
objects O
to O
find O
their O
`` O
natural O
place O
'' O
( O
e.g. O
, O
for O
heavy B-KP
bodies I-KP
to I-KP
fall I-KP
) O
, O
which O
led O
to O
`` O
natural B-KP
motion I-KP
'' O
, O
and O
unnatural B-KP
or O
forced O
motion O
, O
which O
required O
continued B-KP
application I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
force I-KP
. O

This O
theory O
, O
based O
on O
the O
everyday O
experience O
of O
how O
objects O
move O
, O
such O
as O
the O
constant O
application O
of O
a O
force O
needed O
to O
keep O
a O
cart O
moving O
, O
had O
conceptual O
trouble O
accounting O
for O
the O
behavior O
of O
projectiles O
, O
such O
as O
the O
flight O
of O
arrows O
. O

The O
place O
where O
the O
archer O
moves O
the O
projectile O
was O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
flight O
, O
and O
while O
the O
projectile O
sailed O
through O
the O
air O
, O
no O
discernible O
efficient O
cause O
acts O
on O
it O
. O

Aristotle O
was O
aware O
of O
this O
problem O
and O
proposed O
that O
the O
air O
displaced O
through O
the O
projectile O
's O
path O
carries O
the O
projectile O
to O
its O
target O
. O

This O
explanation O
demands O
a O
continuum O
like O
air O
for O
change O
of O
place O
in O
general O
. O

The O
shortcomings O
of O
Aristotelian O
physics O
would O
not O
be O
fully O
corrected O
until O
the B-KP
17th B-KP
century I-KP
work O
of O
Galileo B-KP
Galilei I-KP
, I-KP
who O
was O
influenced O
by O
the O
late O
Medieval O
idea O
that O
objects O
in O
forced O
motion O
carried O
an B-KP
innate B-KP
force I-KP
of I-KP
impetus I-KP
. O

Galileo B-KP
constructed O
an O
experiment O
in O
which O
stones O
and O
cannonballs O
were O
both O
rolled O
down O
an O
incline O
to O
disprove O
the O
Aristotelian O
theory O
of O
motion O
early O
in O
the O
17th O
century O
. O

He O
showed O
that O
the O
bodies O
were O
accelerated O
by O
gravity B-KP
to O
an O
extent O
that O
was O
independent O
of O
their O
mass O
and O
argued O
that O
objects O
retain O
their O
velocity O
unless O
acted O
on O
by O
a O
force B-KP
, O
for O
example O
friction B-KP
. O

Newton B-KP
's I-KP
First O
Law O
of O
Motion O
states O
that O
objects O
continue O
to O
move O
in O
a O
state O
of O
constant O
velocity O
unless O
acted O
upon O
by O
an O
external O
net O
force O
or O
resultant O
force O
. O

This O
law O
is O
an O
extension O
of O
Galileo O
's O
insight O
that O
constant B-KP
velocity I-KP
was I-KP
associated I-KP
with I-KP
a I-KP
lack B-KP
of I-KP
net I-KP
force I-KP
( O
see O
a O
more O
detailed O
description O
of O
this O
below O
) O
. O

Newton B-KP
proposed O
that O
every O
object O
with O
mass O
has O
an O
innate O
inertia O
that O
functions O
as O
the O
fundamental O
equilibrium O
`` O
natural O
state O
'' O
in O
place O
of O
the O
Aristotelian O
idea O
of O
the O
`` O
natural O
state O
of O
rest O
'' O
. O

That O
is O
, O
the O
first B-KP
law I-KP
contradicts O
the O
intuitive O
Aristotelian O
belief O
that O
a O
net O
force O
is O
required O
to O
keep O
an O
object O
moving O
with O
constant O
velocity O
. O

By O
making O
rest O
physically O
indistinguishable O
from O
non O
zero O
constant O
velocity O
, O
Newton B-KP
's I-KP
First I-KP
Law I-KP
directly O
connects O
inertia O
with O
the O
concept O
of O
relative O
velocities O
. O

Specifically O
, O
in O
systems O
where O
objects O
are O
moving O
with O
different O
velocities O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
determine O
which O
object O
is O
`` O
in O
motion O
'' O
and O
which O
object O
is O
`` O
at O
rest O
'' O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
to O
phrase O
matters O
more O
technically O
, O
the B-KP
laws I-KP
of I-KP
physics I-KP
are I-KP
the B-KP
same I-KP
in I-KP
every I-KP
inertial I-KP
frame I-KP
of I-KP
reference I-KP
, O
that O
is O
, O
in O
all O
frames O
related O
by O
a B-KP
Galilean B-KP
transformation I-KP
. O

For O
instance O
, O
while O
traveling O
in O
a O
moving O
vehicle O
at O
a O
constant O
velocity O
, O
the B-KP
laws I-KP
of I-KP
physics I-KP
do O
not O
change O
from O
being O
at O
rest O
. O

A O
person O
can O
throw O
a O
ball O
straight O
up O
in O
the O
air O
and O
catch O
it O
as O
it O
falls O
down O
without O
worrying O
about O
applying O
a O
force O
in O
the O
direction O
the O
vehicle O
is O
moving O
. O

This O
is O
true O
even O
though O
another O
person O
who O
is O
observing O
the O
moving O
vehicle O
pass O
by O
also O
observes O
the O
ball O
follow O
a B-KP
curving B-KP
parabolic I-KP
path I-KP
in O
the O
same O
direction O
as O
the O
motion O
of O
the O
vehicle O
. O

It O
is O
the O
inertia O
of O
the O
ball O
associated O
with O
its O
constant O
velocity O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
vehicle O
's O
motion O
that O
ensures O
the O
ball O
continues O
to O
move O
forward O
even O
as O
it O
is O
thrown O
up O
and O
falls O
back O
down O
. O

From O
the O
perspective O
of O
the O
person O
in O
the O
car O
, O
the B-KP
vehicle I-KP
and I-KP
everything I-KP
inside I-KP
of I-KP
it I-KP
is I-KP
at I-KP
rest I-KP
: I-KP
It O
is O
the O
outside O
world O
that O
is O
moving O
with O
a O
constant O
speed O
in O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O

Since O
there O
is O
no O
experiment O
that O
can O
distinguish O
whether O
it O
is O
the O
vehicle O
that O
is O
at O
rest O
or O
the O
outside O
world O
that O
is O
at O
rest O
, O
the O
two O
situations O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
physically O
indistinguishable O
. O

Inertia B-KP
therefore O
applies O
equally O
well O
to O
constant O
velocity O
motion O
as O
it O
does O
to O
rest O
. O

The O
concept O
of O
inertia B-KP
can O
be O
further O
generalized O
to O
explain O
the O
tendency O
of O
objects O
to O
continue O
in O
many O
different O
forms O
of O
constant O
motion O
, O
even O
those O
that O
are O
not O
strictly O
constant O
velocity O
. O

The B-KP
rotational I-KP
inertia I-KP
of I-KP
planet I-KP
Earth I-KP
is O
what O
fixes O
the O
constancy O
of O
the O
length O
of O
a O
day O
and O
the O
length O
of O
a O
year O
. O

Albert B-KP
Einstein I-KP
extended O
the O
principle O
of O
inertia O
further O
when O
he O
explained O
that O
reference O
frames O
subject O
to O
constant O
acceleration O
, O
such O
as O
those O
free O
falling O
toward O
a O
gravitating O
object O
, O
were O
physically O
equivalent O
to O
inertial O
reference O
frames O
. O

This O
is O
why O
, O
for O
example O
, O
astronauts O
experience O
weightlessness B-KP
when O
in O
free O
fall O
orbit O
around O
the O
Earth O
, O
and O
why O
Newton O
's O
Laws O
of O
Motion O
are O
more O
easily O
discernible O
in O
such O
environments O
. O

If O
an O
astronaut O
places O
an O
object O
with O
mass O
in O
mid O
air O
next O
to O
himself O
, O
it O
will O
remain O
stationary O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
astronaut O
due O
to O
its O
inertia O
. O

This O
is O
the O
same O
thing O
that O
would O
occur O
if O
the O
astronaut O
and O
the O
object O
were O
in O
intergalactic O
space O
with O
no O
net O
force O
of O
gravity O
acting O
on O
their O
shared O
reference O
frame O
. O

This O
principle B-KP
of I-KP
equivalence I-KP
was O
one O
of O
the O
foundational O
underpinnings O
for O
the O
development O
of O
the O
general O
theory O
of O
relativity O
. O

Newton B-KP
's I-KP
Second I-KP
Law I-KP
asserts O
the O
direct O
proportionality O
of O
acceleration O
to O
force O
and O
the O
inverse O
proportionality O
of O
acceleration O
to O
mass O
. O

Accelerations O
can O
be O
defined O
through O
kinematic B-KP
measurements I-KP
. O

However O
, O
while O
kinematics O
are O
well O
described O
through O
reference O
frame O
analysis O
in O
advanced O
physics O
, O
there O
are O
still O
deep O
questions O
that O
remain O
as O
to O
what O
is O
the O
proper O
definition O
of O
mass O
. O

General B-KP
relativity I-KP
offers O
an O
equivalence O
between O
space O
time O
and O
mass O
, O
but O
lacking O
a O
coherent B-KP

The B-KP

that O

that O

The O

Since O

this O

As O
with O

, O
the O

quantified O
using O
precise B-KP

Through B-KP

the O

by O
Newtonian B-KP

Forces O

have O
sizes O

upon I-KP
how I-KP

the O

Because O
of O
these O
characteristics O
, O
forces O
are O
classified O
as O
`` O
vector B-KP

'' O
. O

This O
means O
that O
forces O
follow O
a O

physical O
quantities O
that O

For O

, O
when O
determining O
what O
happens O
when O
two O

act O
on O
the O

both I-KP

If O
both O

the O
situation O

For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
know O
that O
two O
people O
are O
pulling O
on O
the O

with O
known O

but O
you O
do O
not O
know O
which O

either O

pulling O
, O
it B-KP
is I-KP
impossible I-KP
to O
determine O
what O
the O
acceleration O

the O

will O
be O
. O

The O
two O
people O
could O
be O
pulling O

each O

as O
in O
tug O
of O

or O
the O
two O

could O
be O

In O
this O
simple O
one O
dimensional O
example O
, O
without O
knowing B-KP
the I-KP

of I-KP
the I-KP
forces I-KP

is O
impossible O
to O
decide O
whether O
the O

the O
result O
of O
adding B-KP
the I-KP
two I-KP
force I-KP

or I-KP
subtracting I-KP
one I-KP
from I-KP
the I-KP
other I-KP

Associating B-KP
forces I-KP
with I-KP
vectors I-KP
avoids O
such O
problems O
. O

Historically O
, O
forces O
were O
first O
quantitatively O
investigated O
in O
conditions B-KP
of I-KP
static B-KP
equilibrium I-KP
where O
several O
forces O
canceled O
each O
other O
out O
. O

Such O
experiments O
demonstrate O
the O
crucial O
properties O
that O
forces O
are O
additive O
vector O
quantities O
: O
they O
have O
magnitude B-KP
and I-KP
direction I-KP
. O

When O
two O
forces O
act O
on O
a O
point O
particle O
, O
the O
resulting O
force O
, O
the B-KP
resultant I-KP
( I-KP
also I-KP
called I-KP
the I-KP
net B-KP
force I-KP
) I-KP
, O
can O
be O
determined O
by O
following O
the O
parallelogram B-KP
rule O
of O
vector O
addition O
: O
the O
addition O
of O
two O
vectors O
represented O
by O
sides O
of O
a O
parallelogram B-KP
, O
gives O
an O
equivalent O
resultant O
vector O
that O
is O
equal O
in O
magnitude O
and O
direction O
to O
the O
transversal O
of O
the O
parallelogram B-KP

The O
magnitude O
of O
the O

varies O
from O
the O
difference O
of O
the O

the O
two O
forces O
to O
their O
sum O
, O
depending O
on O
the O
angle O

their O
lines O
of O

However O
, O
if O
the O
forces O
are O
acting O
on O
an O
extended O
body O
, O
their B-KP
respective I-KP
lines I-KP

application I-KP
must O
also O
be O
specified O
in O
order O
to O
account O
for O
their B-KP
effects I-KP
on I-KP
the I-KP
motion I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
body I-KP
. O

As O
well O
as O
being O
added O
, O
forces O
can O
also O
be O
resolved O
into O
independent B-KP
components I-KP
at O
right O
angles O
to O
each O
other O
. O

A O
horizontal O
force O
pointing O
northeast O
can O
therefore O
be O
split O
into O
two B-KP
forces O
, O
one O
pointing O
north O
, O
and O
one O
pointing O
east O
. O

Summing O
these O
component O
forces O
using O
vector O
addition O
yields O
the B-KP
original I-KP
force I-KP
. O

Resolving O
force O
vectors O
into O
components O
of O
a O
set O
of O
basis O
vectors O
is O
often O
a O
more O
mathematically O
clean O
way O
to O
describe O
forces O
than O
using O
magnitudes O
and O
directions O
. O

This O
is O
because O
, O
for O
orthogonal B-KP
components I-KP
, O
the O
components O
of O
the O

are O
uniquely B-KP
determined I-KP
by O
the O
scalar O

of O
the O
components O
of O
the O
individual O
vectors O
. O

Orthogonal O
components O
are O
independent O
of O
each O
other O
because O
forces O
acting O
at O
ninety O
degrees O
to O
each O
other O
have O
no O
effect O
on O
the O

Choosing O
a O

orthogonal O

often O
done O
by O
considering O
what O
set O

will O
make O
the O

most O

Choosing O
a O
basis O
vector O
that O
is O
in O
the O
same O
direction O
as O
one O
of O
the O
forces O
is O
desirable O
, O
since O
that O
force O
would O
then O
have O
only O
one O
non O

Orthogonal O

can O
be O
three B-KP

the O

at O

the O

Pushing O
against O
an O
object O
on O
a O
frictional O
surface O
can O
result O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
the O
object O
does O
not O
move O
because O
the O

For O

the O
static O

force O
exactly O
balances O
the O
applied B-KP

The O

up O

A O
static B-KP
equilibrium I-KP
between O
two O
forces O
is O
the O
most O
usual O
way O
of O
measuring O
forces B-KP
, O
using O
simple O
devices O
such O
as O
weighing O

For O
example O
, O
an O

experiences O
the B-KP

a O

Using O
such O
tools O
, O
some O
quantitative O

were O
discovered O
: O
that O
the B-KP

is O
proportional O

These O
were O
all O
formulated O
and O
experimentally O
verified O
before O
Isaac B-KP
Newton I-KP
expounded O
his O
Three O
Laws O
of O
Motion O
. O

Dynamic O
equilibrium O
was O
first O
described O
by O
Galileo B-KP
who O
noticed O
that O
certain O
assumptions O
of O
Aristotelian O
physics O
were O
contradicted O
by O
observations O
and O
logic O
. O

Galileo O
realized O
that O
simple O
velocity O
addition O
demands O
that O
the O
concept O
of O
an O
`` O
absolute O
rest O
frame O
'' O
did O
not O
exist O
. O

Galileo B-KP
concluded O
that O
motion O
in O
a O
constant O
velocity O
was O
completely O
equivalent O
to O
rest B-KP
. O

This O
was O
contrary O
to O
Aristotle B-KP
's I-KP
notion O
of O
a O
`` O
natural O
state O
'' O
of O
rest O
that O
objects O
with O
mass O
naturally O
approached O
. O

Simple O
experiments O
showed O
that O
Galileo O
's O
understanding O
of O
the O
equivalence O
of O
constant O
velocity O
and O
rest O
were O
correct O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
a O
mariner O
dropped O
a O
cannonball O
from O
the O
crow O
's O
nest O
of O
a O
ship O
moving O
at O
a O
constant O
velocity O
, O
Aristotelian O
physics O
would O
have O
the O
cannonball O
fall O
straight B-KP
down I-KP
while O
the O
ship O
moved O
beneath O
it O
. O

Thus O
, O
in O
an O
Aristotelian O
universe O
, O
the O
falling O
cannonball O
would O
land O
behind B-KP
the I-KP
foot I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
mast I-KP
of I-KP
a I-KP
moving I-KP
ship I-KP
. O

However O
, O
when O
this O
experiment O
is O
actually O
conducted O
, O
the O
cannonball O
always O
falls O
at B-KP
the I-KP
foot I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
mast I-KP
, O
as O
if O
the O
cannonball O
knows O
to O
travel O
with O
the O
ship O
despite O
being O
separated O
from O
it O
. O

Since O
there O
is O
no O
forward O
horizontal O
force O
being O
applied O
on O
the O
cannonball O
as O
it O
falls O
, O
the O
only O
conclusion O
left O
is O
that O
the O
cannonball O
continues O
to O
move O
with O
the O
same O
velocity O
as O
the O
boat O
as O
it O
falls O
. O

Thus O
, O
no O
force O
is O
required O
to O
keep O
the O
cannonball O
moving O
at O
the O
constant O
forward O
velocity O
. O

A O
simple O
case O
of O
dynamic B-KP
equilibrium I-KP
occurs O
in O
constant O
velocity O
motion O
across O
a O
surface O
with O
kinetic O
friction O
. O

In O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
a O
force O
is O
applied O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
motion O
while O
the O
kinetic B-KP
friction I-KP
force I-KP
exactly O
opposes O
the O
applied O
force O
. O

This O
results O
in O
zero O
net O
force O
, O
but O
since O
the O
object B-KP
started I-KP
with I-KP
a I-KP
non I-KP
zero I-KP
velocity I-KP
, O
it O
continues O
to O
move O
with O
a O
non O
zero O
velocity O
. O

Aristotle B-KP
misinterpreted O
this O
motion O
as O
being O
caused O
by O
the O
applied O
force O
. O

However O
, O
when O
kinetic B-KP
friction I-KP
is O
taken O
into O
consideration O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
there O
is O
no O
net O
force O
causing O
constant O
velocity O
motion O
. O

The B-KP
notion I-KP
`` I-KP
force I-KP
'' I-KP
keeps O
its O
meaning O
in O
quantum O
mechanics O
, O
though O
one O

by O
the B-KP
Schr B-KP
dinger I-KP
equation I-KP
instead O
of O

This O
has O
the O
consequence O
that O
the O
results O
of O
a O

are O
now O
sometimes O
`` O
quantized B-KP
'' O
, O
i.e O

they O

This O
is O

of O

However O
, O
already O
in O

there O
is O
one O
`` O

, O
namely O
the O

also O

there O

Depending O

identical O

split O

two O

If O
two O

( O

have O
a O
symmetric B-KP
spin O
function O
( O
e.g O

the O

( O
i.e O

they O

( O

Thus O
in O
the O

of O

there O
is O
a O
strictly O

the O

In O

What O
we O
now O
call O
gravity O
was O
not O
identified O
as O
a O
universal O
force O
until O
the O
work O

Isaac B-KP
Newton I-KP
. O

Before O
Newton O
, O
the O
tendency O
for O
objects O
to O
fall O
towards O
the O
Earth O
was O
not O
understood O
to O
be O
related O
to O
the O
motions O
of O
celestial O

. O

Galileo B-KP
was O
instrumental O
in O
describing O
the O
characteristics O

falling O
objects O
by O
determining O
that O
the O
acceleration O

every O
object O

constant O

Today O

this O

, O

points O

This O

that O
the B-KP

gravity I-KP
on I-KP
an I-KP
object I-KP
at O
the O
Earth O

Thus O
an O
object O
that O

a O
mass O

will O
experience O
a O
force O
: O

Newton O
came O
to O
realize O

the O
effects O

might O
be O
observed O
in O
different O
ways O
at B-KP
larger I-KP

In O
particular O
, O
Newton O
determined O
that O
the O
acceleration O

the B-KP
Moon I-KP
around O
the O
Earth O
could O
be O
ascribed O
to O
the B-KP
same I-KP

if I-KP
the I-KP
acceleration I-KP
due I-KP
to I-KP
gravity I-KP
decreased I-KP
as I-KP
an I-KP
inverse I-KP
square I-KP

Further O
, O
Newton O
realized O
that O
the O
acceleration O
due O

gravity O
is O
proportional O
to O
the B-KP
mass I-KP
of I-KP
the I-KP
attracting I-KP

Combining O
these O
ideas O
gives O
a O
formula O
that O

this O

a B-KP
dimensional I-KP
constant I-KP

used O
to O

the O

This O

though O
its O

until O

Newton B-KP

followed O
the O

Succinctly O
stated O

Newton B-KP

that O

that O

explain O

however O

despite O
some O
early O
indications O
, O
no O
such O

be O

When O
Albert B-KP
Einstein I-KP
formulated O
his O
theory B-KP

turned O
his O
attention O

the O
problem O

Mercury O

found O
that O
his O
theory O
added O
a O
correction O

which O
could O
account O

This O
was O
the O
first O

, O
general B-KP

been O
acknowledged O

the O
theory O

In O

From O
the B-KP

the I-KP

all O
